	<p align='center'><b>RETHINKING OUR MISSION<br/> Wayne McDill</b></p> <p>A number of state legislatures have enacted &ldquo;Sunset Laws&rdquo; in an effort to control the growth of government. These laws force the state to review each agency periodically to see if it really needs to continue. When the review time comes, agency personnel appear before the appropriate committee to explain how the agency is still needed. Otherwise funding stops. The people who work for the agency are out of a job. Records go into storage and a more useful agency gets the office space. Legislators are deciding to let the sun set on any agency whose service is no longer needed.</p> <p>Each of these government agencies began to meet some need. Over the course of the years, however, conditions change. Different services are needed. A similar thing can happen to a church. The church may begin with an enthusiastic commitment to clear and worthy aims. Through the years, however, a church can lose that enthusiasm and clarity of purpose. </p> <p><b>Movement or Institution?</b></p> <p>This loss of purpose very often has to do with the natural course of development for a church. It may begin with a small group of people determined to make difference for Christ. They have found forgiveness and peace in Him and they want to share it. They are zealous. They are energized. They link themselves with others of the same spirit. They are spontaneous and bold in their witness. They are unencumbered with the clutter of normal church activity. You might say they are part of a <i>movement.</i> </p> <p>But <i>movements</i>tend always toward institutionalization. The differences between <i>movements</i>and <i>institutions</i>are predictable. Institutions are movements that become crystallized. By &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo; I mean hardened, set, structured. Think of Jesus ministering throughout the hills of Galilee with twelve followers. Then picture the vast institutions of Christianity today-the denominations, the facilities, the billions of dollars, the professional staffs. That is what happens to movements.</p> <p>Sometimes churches today cannot remember the movement that gave them birth. They don&rsquo;t remember the zeal, the sacrifice, and the struggle. They don&rsquo;t remember the simplicity and clarity of vision that energized the founding group. They have instead become entangled in the bondage of institutionalization. The original dream of the movement has become smothered in the very structures established to fulfill that dream.</p> <p>Even the most ardent believer finds himself drawn by a magnetic attraction to the structure and order of institutionalization. The advocates of a movement first seek a name for their group. They move on to organize, to elect leaders, to purchase equipment, to write a constitution and bylaws, to plan programs, to hire staff, and to build buildings. Ultimately they find the zeal for their movement being replaced by attention to the demands of the institution.</p> <p>Even missionary church planters are affected by the lure of institutionalization. Instead of setting out to be a catalyst for a movement of God, they are thinking about establishing a church. And by &ldquo;church&rdquo; we mean an institution with a building and meetings and programs. We do not mean the body of Christ, the regenerate people. So the church planter seeks to enlist the help of others for establishing a church. His driving thought may not be what he can do to minister the grace of God to them. Instead he is motivated by what they can do for him in starting the church.</p> <p>A church can begin with a commitment to the purpose for which it exists, and then slip in to a commitment to the existence of the church<i>.</i> Its only aim becomes its own survival. Sermons may call members to influence the community. But the real purpose can be seen in the activity of the members. The important business of the church seems to be meeting to promote the next meeting. The great challenge is keeping the apathetic members coming to the meetings.</p> <p>Jesus wrote a sobering warning to the church at Ephesus, &ldquo;Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love. Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place&rdquo; (Revelation 2:4, 5). That church began with a commitment to the Great Commission of Christ. But the church fell away to a commitment to self-preservation. Jesus threatened to remove the light of His divine presence and power from them. In a sense this would revoke their &ldquo;franchise.&rdquo; He told them they must return to the purpose He gave them or go out of business.</p> <p>Sadly, many churches today are trying to carry on, even though they have lost sight of their mission. They seem to live only for themselves. The community does not feel their influence. They still meet and go through the motions, but the power of Christ is not in their work. They seem primarily concerned with keeping the machinery turning. The people are bored. The leaders are frustrated. The world goes on about its business as though the church weren&rsquo;t there. </p> <p>The great need of the hour is a re-discovery of the real purpose of Christ for the church. Only then will He involve Himself dynamically in the life of the congregation.</p> <p><b>The Founding Purpose</b></p> <p>This brings us to the big question: what is Christ&rsquo;s purpose for the church? Let&rsquo;s examine the Great Commission of Jesus to understand what the church is to be about. The most familiar expression of this command is found in Matthew 28:18-20,</p> <p>Then Jesus came to them and said, &ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&rdquo;</p> <p>The words of this passage are so familiar they tend to lose their meaning. To those few disciples who first heard it, however, this was a revolutionary challenge. Even those who thought Him to be the Messiah were thinking of Jewish national salvation. It didn&rsquo;t occur to them that their Rabbi had anything to do with the far reaches of the world. And they hardly thought of the destiny of unborn multitudes of Gentiles. How could 120 followers possibly hope to obey the world-encompassing command He gave them?</p> <p>Notice first that Jesus claimed for Himself unprecedented authority. He said He had been given <i>all</i> authority. Paul wrote that God &ldquo;exalted Him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, . . . and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father&rdquo; (Philippians 2:9-11). This total authority is the basis for the Commission Jesus gives. Without authority from God the mission would be impossible.</p> <p>In a sense the Great Commission is an authority issue. Jesus is saying, &ldquo;I have been given all authority; now you make it a reality in the world.&rdquo; He closes the command with the promise that He is with them to the end of all time. This is all they would need, that He be with them. When He is present there is never a shortage of power, never a lack of wisdom, never a loss of direction. What more could they ask? </p> <p>Most of us have been taught that the command of the Great Commission is &ldquo;Go ye therefore.&rdquo; The verb forms used in the passage, however, give us a different picture. The only command in the statement is the word translated &ldquo;make disciples.&rdquo; The other action words are present participles, which actually mean &ldquo;going,&rdquo; &ldquo;baptizing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;teaching.&rdquo; Jesus&rsquo; primary interest, then, is that we <i>make disciples</i>. The other verbs describe how this work is to be done.</p> <p><b>Making Disciples</b></p> <p>Evangelism must aim beyond decisions to disciples. We must never be satisfied to count our converts before there is evidence of transformation. Church Growth pioneer Donald McGavran defined evangelism as &ldquo;to proclaim Jesus Christ as God and Savior, to persuade people to become his disciples and responsible members of his church.&rdquo;<a href='#_edn1' name='_ednref1'>[1]</a> </p> <p>The idea of making disciples is rich with meaning. &ldquo;Disciple&rdquo; is a relationship word. It refers to one who is closely related personally to a particular teacher or master. The disciple is committed, not only to the teachings of the master, but also to his values and his mission in life. Jesus indicated that a disciple would want to become like his master (Matthew 10:25). </p> <p>A disciple of Jesus Christ is not merely a religious adherent. He commits his very life to Christ. Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me&rdquo; (Mark 8:34). He made clear that His disciples should be ready to lose their lives for His sake and the gospel&rsquo;s.</p> <p>What a different view of the Great Commission we see today. Some feel we have fulfilled our responsibility when we have given a person one gospel witness or a piece of literature. One writer even asserted that America is &ldquo;over evangelized&rdquo; because of the number of churches, Christian colleges, gospel radio stations, and people who believe in God. But what about real disciples? Shouldn&rsquo;t we count the disciples? Does the mere establishment of Christian institutions fulfill the Great Commission? If America is over-evangelized, why is it not transformed by the presence of Christ?</p> <p>Perhaps the problem comes in the seeming impossibility of obeying the Great Commission as Jesus stated it. He sent us to enlist committed followers from every kind of people. He well knew that merely being exposed to the truth does not make a disciple. Nor is a token response adequate. There is a dynamic relationship involved. The church has searched for easy, mass, instant, sure-fire evangelism. And this search has tended to lead us away from one necessary ingredient for discipleship--relationships. The right kind of evangelism will aim for relationship as the test of response. And it will depend on the building of relationships to make disciples.</p> <p>Making disciples means the church seeks to lead the unbeliever into a deep and unreserved commitment to Jesus as Lord of his life. Anything less than this is a failure to minister the fullness of God&rsquo;s grace to him. God can work His wonders only in a life yielded to Him. When we invite people to a cheap and easy acknowledgment of Christ, we cheat them out of the riches of abundant life. For the sake of numbers enlisted through easy evangelism, we offer the unbeliever only as much Christianity as he is willing to accept. The tragic results of this approach are all around us.</p> <p>Another corruption of contemporary evangelistic appeals is that they picture the Christian life as rather privatistic. They may well present a call for discipleship, but the call is not often to a public discipleship. The biblical view is that the disciple is called out of the world to a new life in Christ and immediately sent back into the world by commission of God. Limiting discipleship to the <i>spiritual</i> dimension alone is mistaken. Focusing the new believer&rsquo;s attention only on his own experience--his prayer and devotional life, his personal need for peace and assurance, his study of Scripture--is a mistaken view that misses the costly call of Christ.</p> <p>Because of the weakness in our evangelism we have a serious &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; problem. Calling only for &ldquo;decisions for Christ,&rdquo; we are then dissatisfied when that is all we get. We then face the frustration of attempting to sell the new convert on a different version of Christianity than we first presented to him. As a result of this failure a &ldquo;discipleship&rdquo; emphasis has developed in Christianity. </p> <p>Whenever there is a serious weakness in the church, someone will come along to try and correct the error. In the process, the correction often turns out to be the central feature in a new movement. The contemporary discipleship movement seeks to bring such a corrective. But let&rsquo;s recognize that Jesus meant discipleship to be the standard version of Christianity in the first place. </p> <p>Whereas the only imperative of the Great Commission is &ldquo;make disciples,&rdquo; the other verbs clarify for us how this is to be done. Jesus said, &ldquo;Make disciples--going, baptizing and teaching.&rdquo; This continuing activity of the church is precisely what needs to be done today. Otherwise, we cannot be effective in our central task. Look at the meaning of these terms for our work. </p> <p><b>Penetrating the Community. </b></p> <p>The first of these indications of ongoing activity for making disciples is &ldquo;going.&rdquo; This &ldquo;Going&rdquo; pictures the mobility of the church as a part of the flow of the world&rsquo;s traffic. Our task here calls for the <i>penetration</i> of the unbelieving community with our salt and light influence for Christ. If a church is to be effective in evangelism, the believers will have to involve themselves with the unbelieving world.</p> <p>Christians tend to isolate themselves from association with unbelievers. We naturally gravitate toward our Christian friends. We enjoy the fellowship. We trust them. I have found that believers over fifty years of age often can name very few people they know personally who give no evidence of being Christian. But the gospel moves best by far along lines of relationship. If we are to influence unbelievers, we will have to cultivate those relationships intentionally. </p> <p>Wherever God calls us to serve, we are to put ourselves into the middle of the troubles of a hurting world. The world needs that presence for the marriage that is crumbling, the young person in ghetto streets, the grieving widow, and the aimless drug addict. But being a reconciling presence in the world is risky business. It means getting under the load. It means suffering the consequences with those who desperately need the good news of Christ&rsquo;s love. </p> <p>The meaningful involvement of Christians with unbelievers is the crucial challenge if our penetration is to be effective. Ralph Neighbour brings the issue home to us: &ldquo;The solution to the problem is a deeply personal one: every single Christian must become responsible for getting involved with outsiders. We hold back in fear of getting &lsquo;hurt.&rsquo; It takes one&rsquo;s whole being to love, and the cost is great.&rdquo;<a href='#_edn2' name='_ednref2'>[2]</a> However comfortable we may be spending all our time with other believers, that is not the meaning of &ldquo;going&rdquo; in the Great Commission.</p> <p><sup></sup><i>Penetration</i>is the first principle of our involvement with our world. In the offices, in the schools, in the plants, in the neighborhoods--it is there that Christians are to penetrate their secular society. Unless this deliberate reaching out to unbelievers is going on outside the church building, what goes on inside it may well be irrelevant for evangelism. In his &ldquo;going&rdquo; every Christian charts the boundaries of his own personal mission field. In these every-day contacts he is the key to the penetrating influence of the church.</p> <p><b>Converting the Lost. </b></p> <p>The second continuing activity for making disciples is <i>conversion</i>. The word &ldquo;baptizing&rdquo; brings to mind the transforming impact the church can have on its community. Baptism pictures the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. It portrays as well the radical change in the individual--from death to life, from old man to new man, from self-centered to Christ-centered, from the world to the church. Baptism shows the turn-around, the total conversion that can be a reality only by the power of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>Baptism presents the testimony of the new believer. He was spiritually dead and now he is alive. He has heard the call of God and has surrendered. He has trusted Jesus as his Savior and Lord. This conversion is necessary to disciple making. A person must come to that repentance and faith that leaves his old life and embraces a new life in Christ. Unless the congregation is intentional about bringing people to Christ, it can never be faithful to its mission to make disciples. </p> <p>It sometimes sounds old fashioned to say that those without Christ are lost. But that is what the Bible makes clear. However caring believers may be in their outreach to unbelievers, we must never be satisfied merely to make them feel better. We must never aim to make them more comfortable in their darkness, but to bring them into the light. However affluent and self-satisfied an unbeliever may appear, without Christ he is lost. Jesus was present and in touch to &ldquo;to seek and to save what was lost&rdquo; (Luke 19:10). That search goes on.</p> <p>Becoming a Christian is not just a spiritual transaction isolated to one aspect of life. It is a total transformation of every part of who we are. It involves reconstructing all our normal patterns: our friends, our entertainment, and our approach to our jobs. The unbeliever considering this new life may wonder what Christians do besides go to church. What pleasures do they have if they do not drink, gamble, or sleep around? It is our task to help the seeker and the new Christian to understand the answers to these questions.</p> <p><b>Transforming Worldviews. </b></p> <p>The third activity for making disciples is seen in the idea of &ldquo;teaching them to observe all I have commanded you.&rdquo; This continuing activity we may call <i>transformation</i>. A new convert brings with him all his old thinking. Conversion does not automatically reprogram his mind. He now begins the lifelong process of adjusting his thinking to the revealed truth of God. He is admonished to &ldquo;be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God&rsquo;s will is-his good, pleasing and perfect will&rdquo; (Romans 12:2).</p> <p>There is no substitute for teaching the Bible to new believers. Only through life-oriented Bible study will they grow as disciples. Bible study must not be a history lesson. It must not be a study of ancient cultures and quaint customs. It is not even a study of the lives of long-dead religious people. Bible study that makes a difference connects biblical truth with life. It is the study of God&rsquo;s living word, which &ldquo;judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart&rdquo; (Hebrews 4:12). </p> <p>We have already noted the contemporary shift in worldview that is taking place all around us. At one time in this country, almost everyone in the community believed that the world was pretty much as the Bible describes it. But now, our neighbors my have secular worldviews that are fully contrary to the biblical view. They may be infected with Eastern religious thinking like that presented in Transcendental Meditation or Yoga. New converts will need to be taught the biblical view. Our churches are full of people who think of themselves as Christians, but have never experienced the transformation of worldview necessary to a disciple of Christ.</p> <p>We make a serious mistake when we think growth in discipleship is only a matter of gaining knowledge. Spiritual insights from Bible study are a necessary part of the process. But the fellowship of Christians is just as vital. The key factor in the development of Jesus&rsquo; disciples is that they were &ldquo;with him&rdquo; (Mark 3:14). It seems clear that He did not see their growth in terms of knowledge acquired so much as in a living faith. This faith arose in ministry and fellowship with Him. Only in that context did the things He taught have real meaning.</p> <p>The word &ldquo;disciple&rdquo; is used 261 times in the Gospels and Acts. But in the Epistles it is not used at all. This is significant. But what does it mean? Could it be that as the church developed, the emphasis shifted from the relationship of the believer to Christ to his relationship with the church body? It is not that our personal faith in Christ is not important. It is the most important. Since Jesus has ascended and sent the Spirit, we relate in practical ways to the &ldquo;Body of Christ,&rdquo; the church community. For the church, this points up the important responsibility we have for the nurture and training of every believer.</p> <p>If we would make disciples we must be about the business of &ldquo;going,&rdquo; &ldquo;baptizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;teaching.&rdquo; A close examination of the activities of a church or an individual believer should reveal all three of these principles at work--<i>penetration</i>, <i>conversion</i>, and <i>transformation</i>. We must plan carefully for each kind of activity or we will not be successful in making disciples. Weakness in even one of these areas will make the whole process essentially ineffective.</p> <p><b>The Crucial Choice</b></p> <p>A recovery of purpose has a dramatic effect on a church or an individual believer. Here is the key to motivation. As we give ourselves to that great calling which was the founding aim of the church, there is a new vitality in every activity. Meetings to plan Great Commission strategy are alive with meaning. Attention of church leaders is turned away from the maintenance of the institution for its own sake. Worship focuses on the mighty God and His sure purposes in the world. The people respond with commitment because here is a cause worthy of sacrifice. The power of God is manifested because the church brings itself under the Lordship of Christ in a commitment to His purpose.</p> <p>Relational evangelism can be the foundation for just such a recovery of purpose. As the church looks beyond its own survival to the needs of the multitudes about it, Christians awaken to their own calling. They see a new dimension of meaning in their daily activity. They begin to find their personal ministry and seek a better understanding of their spiritual equipment for the task. They are involved with their Lord in the work closest to His own heart.</p> <div align='left'>Wayne McDill</div> <div align='left'>Senior Professor of Preaching</div> <div align='left'>Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br/> <hr align='left' width='33%' size='1'/></div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' name='_edn1'>[1]</a> Donald P.
