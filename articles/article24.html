	<p align='center'><b>A THREE-STORY WITNESS<br/> Wayne McDill</b></p> <p>A story is a wonderful thing. All children like stories, and in that regard we are all children. The most fascinating kind of story may be the biography. These are the real stories of real people. Most biographies, however, are about famous people whose lives have made a real difference, for good or ill. Not many biographies are written about the ordinary, inconsequential lives that leave no lasting mark in history. But every life is precious to God. Every day is recorded in his book (Psalm 139:16).</p> <p>A life story is not one story but many stories within the story. Woven together like patches of a quilt, each episode has its own beginning and end. Each has its setting and cast of characters. Each has its plot. And each makes its contribution to the life story. These episodes can be grouped into chapters like &ldquo;Growing up in the Country,&rdquo; &ldquo;How We Met and Married,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moving to Dallas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Children and a Mortgage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jody, Leukemia, and Heartbreak&rdquo; &ldquo;The Empty Nest,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Heart Attack,&rdquo; &ldquo;Growing Old Gracefully.&rdquo;</p> <p>Every human life is a story, even if it is never written. Every life story has its own twists and turns. But most of our stories are never told. Days reach into years; the record of these events, thoughts and emotions are lost in the silent memories. Yet in those stories is another story, the drama of God&rsquo;s patience and love as He calls each of us to Himself. But often unnoticed, this part of the story awaits the insight that only faith can give it.</p> <p>We have already said that effective evangelism is tuned in to the life of your unbelieving neighbor. Your witness can begin with his story. Then it can move to your own story, your testimony of what God has done in your life. Finally it can deal with Jesus&rsquo; story, the good news of how God made it possible for us to be reconciled with Him. This is a <i>three-story</i> witness.</p> <p><b>How Stories Unfold</b></p> <p>There is a usual pattern common to all stories. They have a beginning and an end. They pass through certain phases as the tale unfolds. When you recognize these phases, you can track the story of your friend. You can also make sure your own stories are complete. And seeing this pattern can help us to tell the stories of Jesus as we present the gospel. Think of a story in five phases: <i>situation</i>, <i>stress</i>, <i>search</i>, <i>solution</i>, <i>and (new) situation</i>. </p> <p><b>The Situation: </b>The opening <i>situation</i> includes the background of the story. There is a setting, and there are characters involved. This is the &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; phase of the story. Here is the opening situation in Martha&rsquo;s story: &ldquo;We had just moved to Dayton for Jim&rsquo;s new job. We had three children and I was pregnant with the fourth. We bought a bigger house than we had in St. Louis. It was a nice neighborhood. We were excited about the move. The older kids liked their school.&rdquo; This kind of setup almost anticipates the next phase.</p> <p><b>The Stress. </b>The second phase of the story is the <i>stress</i> stage<i>.</i> At this point trouble comes. This is the turn in the story that gives it energy and interest. You almost want to say, &ldquo;I knew it! Something had to happen.&rdquo; We are used to our stories having these distressing turns. Martha continues: &ldquo;I began to notice that Jim seemed distracted. He said it was just the job. He had to work late one or two nights a week. We had been in Dayton about a year at that time. Then I found the note. I was devastated. Who was Lisa? Why would she write my husband a note like that?&rdquo; There is stress! Now the story becomes compelling.</p> <p><b>The Search. </b>Phase three of a story is the <i>search</i> for a resolution to the trouble. We naturally go to work on the problem, to find a solution. This <i>search</i> may include a number of different attempts to resolve the problem. Back to Martha&rsquo;s story: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I had found the note in a shirt pocket when I did the wash. I cried most of that day and tried to carry on for the children. I wondered, &ldquo;Is this my fault? What should I do now? Should I confront him as soon as he gets home? Or should I just keep quiet.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone to talk to but my sister, so I called her and told her about the note.&rdquo;</p> <p>The <i>search</i> phase of the story is usually the longest part. It is here that the story draws you in and keeps you interested as the heroine works her way through the difficult challenge of resolving the trouble. &ldquo;I confronted Jim later that week. He denied it. I cried. I screamed. He got angry. But he never did explain the note very well. I demanded that he stop working late. He said that wasn&rsquo;t up to him, that I was being unreasonable. A wall had come between us. Anyway, to shorten the story, he finally admitted the affair. He said he loved me and wanted to make a new start. But I didn&rsquo;t see how things could ever be the same.&rdquo;</p> <p>There is much more to Martha&rsquo;s story than space allows here. It is the very kind of story you will hear when you take the time to listen. Not at first, of course. But as you continue to listen carefully, you will earn the trust given to a real friend. It may well be that you learn of the story before it is resolved. The <i>search</i> phase may still be in progress. Keep that in mind as we consider the final two phases.</p> <p><b>The Solution. </b>Phase four is the <i>solution</i>. At this point the trouble is resolved. The search is rewarded with a settling of the issue. As believers we know that the best possible solution is the intervention of God himself. It is trust in Him and obedience to His word that brings His power to bear in troubled lives. We have the privilege of presenting that good news. As we listen carefully, we will hear the longing for help and find a special point of contact for the gospel of Christ.</p> <p><b>The (New) Situation. </b>The final phase is the <i>(new) situation</i>. Whatever solution is applied, things are not the same as they were. The trouble changed the dynamic so that you cannot go back. In their ignorance or stubbornness, however, people often choose solutions to their trouble that come to a tragic end. Martha, for instance, could have refused any reconciliation and insisted on divorce. Her new situation would have been a sad and pitiful end to the story. The new situation would be Martha trying to raise four children alone while working to make a living for the family. </p> <p>As you listen to your friend, you can recognize what the story is and where it is going. Seeing the various phases unfold will help you to know what kind of witness would be appropriate. You will be adapting your ministry and your message to the need of your friend. No matter what the story, God has a word of good news for that situation. No matter how distressed the storyteller, God&rsquo;s grace can meet the need. </p> <p><b>Your Friend&rsquo;s Story</b></p> <p>Surveys indicate that most people are fairly satisfied with their lives. Do not think that every unbeliever is at a loss for how to live his life. Like an animal adapted to the darkness of a cave, he may have learned to survive. He may not even know about the light. Whatever his beliefs, there are gaps in his story. He may have some sense of unease, even a deep conviction of incompleteness. Or he may be oblivious to his need for God. </p> <p>He may even think he has an answer to most of life&rsquo;s questions. But until you or some other believer tells him the rest of his story, he doesn&rsquo;t know what he is missing. For the big questions in every life, only God&rsquo;s answers complete the story. Look at some of these questions.</p> <p><i>Who am I?</i> Most of us answer that question with our name. Or we may add occupation, family connections, age, and other factors. But the question goes deeper than that. It is the question of identity. The Bible offers a surprising portrait of any and all human beings. Your neighbor may not know that he is made intentionally in the very image of God (Genesis 3:27). Even though he is made in the likeness of God, he is part of a corrupt human race. All mankind has fallen in sin and tries to live independently of God. Your friend may not know that he is the prodigal son whom the Father loves.</p> <p><i>Where did I come from?</i> This is the question of origins. Your neighbor probably does not know that he is &ldquo;fearfully and wonderfully made.&rdquo; He has not considered that God formed his inward parts and covered him in his mother&rsquo;s womb. He cannot say with King David, &ldquo;My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought.&rdquo; (Psalm 139:13-15) He doesn&rsquo;t know that God has &ldquo;made him a little lower than the angels&rdquo; and &ldquo;crowned him with glory and honor.&rdquo; (Psalm 8:5) Instead, he may believe that he has evolved from the primordial slime. </p> <p><i>Why am I here?</i> This question of purpose will cross the mind of almost every person at one time or another. Most people try to answer that question with some personal desire of achievement. But few will know that they are put on this earth by God to represent Him here. In their independence from God, it never occurs to them that their highest purpose is to glorify their Creator. They do not realize that they are here to be agents of God on earth, to carry out His will and to give his grace and love to others.</p> <p><i>Where am I going?</i> The question of destiny includes the future in this life and beyond. Your neighbor probably has some sense that his spirit or soul or something will live on when he dies. But he may not know that God offers him eternal life in Jesus Christ. You can fill in these gaps in his story. You can tell him what Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die.&rdquo; (John 11:25, 26) You can tell him that putting his faith in Christ will bring eternal life.</p> <p>Think what a privilege it is to be the one to tell your friend the rest of his own story. As you become better acquainted, you will soon see where the gaps are. Every person has the inherent desire to answer these big questions. When the answers are not available, he is forced to wait and hope that some day he will find them. At the center of it all is that &ldquo;God-shaped vacuum&rdquo; that can never be filled, except through a personal and living relationship with Christ. </p> <p><b>Your Own Story</b></p> <p>After you focus on your friend&rsquo;s story, you may find it helpful to turn to your own. Just like everyone else on earth, you have a story. Your life story is still unfolding. And you also have those many short stories, those chapters in the book. The most critical story you have may be the account of how you came to trust Christ as your Savior. Many believers think of their story of coming to Christ as very predictable; they were brought up in a Christian home. There isn&rsquo;t much drama there. Nevertheless, remember that no one but you has exactly your story. </p> <p>Think through your conversion testimony. If you were saved as an adult, it may be a dramatic story of repentance and faith. If you trusted Jesus as a child, it may be less dramatic. Either way, write it out and plan how you can tell it in a few minutes. A good outline to follow is this: (1) My life before knowing Christ as my Savior; (2) How I came to realize I needed Christ; (3) How I put my trust in Him; (4) How God has changed my life.</p> <p>As important as your conversion testimony is, you also have many other stories to tell. Any chapter in your life that includes a need you had, how you trusted God with that need, and how God met your need-this can be a testimony as well. The fact that God has worked in your life is a strong indication that He will also work in the lives of others. God&rsquo;s method of revelation is to intervene in the lives of men. He does this often at the point of their need. The Bible is full of such stories. God can also reveal Himself through your experience. </p> <p>You have learned many a lesson through what has happened in your life and what God has said to you in the midst of it. God made Himself known to you as He answered prayers. He gave His grace at the very point of your need. When you tell stories of those experiences, you can help another person better understand God and what to expect from Him. God will work in him as He has in you. Testimony is a very good way to witness to others. </p> <p>One more thing: all our own experience with God we must filter through the texts of Scripture. Once the New Testament era closed and the Bible was complete, the theology of the church was settled. It is a mistake to judge Scripture by our human experience. Scripture must test all our understanding and every experience as well. So when we share a testimony from our own walk with Christ, we want to make sure that it passes the test of biblical truth. </p> <p><b>Jesus&rsquo; Story</b></p> <p>One of the most exciting methods today for evangelism on the mission fields of the world is &ldquo;Chronological Bible Storying.&rdquo; For the most part, the peoples of the world cannot read. Though a country may claim a literacy rate of more than 50%, the functional literacy rate may be closer to 10%. For some people groups there is no Bible written in their language, even if they could read it. And for others there is no writing for their language at all.</p> <p>Several decades ago missionaries began to develop various versions of the &ldquo;storying method&rdquo; to communicate the Bible message to people who cannot or will not read. The witness memorizes stories from the Bible and tells them like you would a children&rsquo;s story. The stories begin with the Creation in Genesis and continue historically through the Bible. They come to a climax in the death and resurrection of Jesus. They are simple. They are accurate to Scripture. And they are very effective to carry the message to the hearer.</p> <p>One fascinating benefit for chronological Bible storying is that those in cultures used to storytelling can quickly learn them. One missionary told a story for the first time in their native language to a group in a remote village. Afterward, she asked whether someone in the group might remind them of what the story was about. One man immediately stood and recited the complete story, using much of the same phraseology she did. He had learned it in one hearing.</p> <p>The Gospel is Jesus&rsquo; story. When the eyewitnesses to Jesus&rsquo; life wanted to tell about Him, they did not write a systematic theology book. They wrote a story. And in that story were many episodes, little stories that made up the whole narrative. Besides that, Jesus told stories to communicate His ideas to the people. These parables are also in narrative form. Most of the time the &ldquo;point&rdquo; of these stories is not stated outright, either in the episodes of Jesus&rsquo; life or in the parables.</p> <p>The biblical stories themselves carry the truth about God. They may have an explanation from time to time, but basically the message is in the story. When you move from your friend&rsquo;s story, to your story, to Jesus&rsquo; story, you will be able to adapt your witness to the very point of need in your friend&rsquo;s life. If you learned that Martha&rsquo;s story was in the <i>search</i> phase, you would know she is looking for answers. But mostly she just wants to have things back as they were before Jim&rsquo;s affair. She may not be thinking about a whole new life in Christ. But her trouble may be an opportunity to raise with her the bigger issue of her relationship with Christ.</p> <p><b>A Story for Martha</b></p> <p>So, after hearing her story, you might tell her a story of your own. You need not have a story of marital unfaithfulness. Just tell her of an experience in which you were at your wit&rsquo;s end and how God came through with His grace. From her story to your story, you now move to Jesus&rsquo; story. But what do you tell? How about the story of the Woman at the Well in John 4? It is a tale of marital love and unfaithfulness and how Jesus changed her life. </p> <p>Maybe you could tell it like this:</p> <p>Jesus met a woman one time whose husband had been unfaithful to her. In fact, she had had five husbands and finally just lived with a man she didn&rsquo;t marry. She was soured on marriage and on men. Her life was a sad story of betrayal and the search for love that would last. </p> <p>But one day she came to draw water at a well where Jesus was resting, tired from a long journey. He asked her for a drink of water. But she was cynical. She may have thought he was coming on to her. &ldquo;Why do you ask me for a drink,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Men ought not to speak to women they don&rsquo;t know, and Jews don&rsquo;t talk to Samaritans.&rdquo;</p> <p>Jesus said, &ldquo;If you knew who I was, you would ask me for a drink and I would give you living water.&rdquo;</p> <p>She answered with a smirk, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even have a jar to get water and this well is deep. So where would you get such living water.&rdquo; </p> <p>Jesus ignored her attitude and got to the point of her pain. &ldquo;Go and call your husband,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a husband,&rdquo; she answered. I imagine her tossing her head in disgust with all men.</p> <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; Jesus answered. &ldquo;You have had five husbands and the man you are living with now is not your husband.&rdquo;</p> <p>Her attitude changed when she saw that Jesus knew so much about her. They continued to talk until He told her he was the Messiah. Then she ran back to the village and told everyone that he was there at the well. They all came out to hear him. And many believed in Jesus because of the life-changing testimony of that woman. She had found the love of God that would never fail her.</p> <p>You could tell Martha you know she is hurt and disappointed. You could stop and pray with her that her marriage would be restored. God wants marriage to be a loving and lasting relationship. He wants children to have a happy and loving family to nurture them. But you can tell her that no matter how unfaithful men can be, God&rsquo;s love never fails. &ldquo;God loves you and wants to give you new life. Just like the woman at the well, something is missing besides a faithful husband.&rdquo;</p> <p>Like the woman at the well, she may have questions. Now you have an opportunity to explain the gospel and pray with her to put her faith in Christ. In doing so she is putting her life, and her marriage, in God&rsquo;s hands. Even if she was faithful in her marriage, she is in need of forgiveness. She needs a relationship with God in which she is His own child. She needs to trust Him with every need. Even though her marriage trouble was your point of contact for testimony and gospel, you will always come at last to the basic need for reconciliation with God.</p> <p>As you listen to your friend&rsquo;s story, depend on the Holy Spirit to guide you. Ask God to show you what to tell of your own story, and what to tell of Jesus&rsquo; story. As you read the gospels, you may want to write out a simple account of stories that impress you for a witness. Look at Jesus&rsquo; midnight visit with Nicodemus in John 3. The main message there is &ldquo;You must be born again.&rdquo; Look at the story of Paul&rsquo;s conversion in Acts 9, and as he retells it in Acts 22. The theme there is &ldquo;I was so religious and so wrong until God stopped me in my tracks and set me on the right path.&rdquo; Look at the parable of the Prodigal Son in Luke 15. Here is the story of a rebel who came to his senses and came back to a father who never stopped loving him. And the parable of the lost sheep in that same chapter also pictures the seeking heart of God. </p> <p>Once you begin to see the witness potential of these fascinating stories, you will discover many more that you can tell. Don&rsquo;t tell them as religious legends, but as real events that happened to real people. In them is revealed something of the character and grace of God. They are full of divine truth clothed in the ordinary apparel of human experience. You may well find that though these stories are very familiar to you, they will be new to your unbelieving friends. And even if they have heard them, your telling them in a fresh way will give them a new significance.</p> <p><b>Clarifying the Gospel</b></p> <p>The most important story of all, however, is what we call the &ldquo;gospel&rdquo;. In its narrowest sense it is the New Testament account of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus. Paul wrote, &ldquo;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and . . . He was buried, and . . . He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and . . . He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.&rdquo; He says he was also seen alive by hundreds more. This story of Jesus is the essence of the gospel.</p> <p>But the gospel has a broader definition. It includes the meaning of Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection. It is Jesus &ldquo;whom God set forth <i>as</i> a propitiation by His blood&rdquo; (Romans 3:25), &ldquo;who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness----by whose stripes you were healed&rdquo; (1 Peter 2:24), so that &ldquo;in Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace&rdquo; (Ephesians 1:7).</p> <p>These texts give us the basic idea of the gospel of Jesus Christ. But as you communicate the gospel truth to your neighbor, consider several ideas to keep in mind. </p> <p><i>The gospel is about Jesus, not about us</i>. It is not about what we are to do to satisfy God, but what Jesus has already done. It is not about what happens in our lives as what happened in the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The gospel is the report that in Christ God has done all that can be done to reconcile man to Himself.</p> <p><i>The gospel is good news, not bad.</i> I have heard for years that real preaching and witnessing ought to &ldquo;step on our toes.&rdquo; It ought to be about how we are all sinners and bound for hell when we die. Though there is clear biblical truth in that statement, the gospel emphasizes the good news of God&rsquo;s remedy for our sins. We do not skirt the issue of sin, but neither do we dwell there. Jesus&rsquo; story is not the story of sin, but of salvation, not of judgment but of acceptance.</p> <p><i>The gospel is about grace, not works.</i> I have found in witnessing that most people, even Christians, think that their standing with God is connected with their good deeds. In a survey of Christians of six major denominations, over two-thirds said they had difficulty accepting salvation as a gift rather than something earned.<a href='#_edn1' name='_ednref1'>[1]</a> However common this view is, it is incorrect. Jesus sacrifice for us on the cross has made salvation free to us. It is a gift of God&rsquo;s grace. Nothing we do can add to it or take away from it.</p> <p><i>The gospel faces the problem of sin, not avoiding it.</i> Though the gospel is not bad news, but good, it deals realistically with man&rsquo;s alienation from God. The Bible says that unregenerate man is &ldquo;dead in trespasses and sins&rdquo; (Ephesians 2:1). This is not a minor problem. It is not only a psychological problem or an educational problem or a character problem or a moral problem. It is all of that. But the problem of sin goes deeper. It is essentially an independent spirit by which a person rejects or ignores God in his life. That attitude leads to moral impurity, the emotional distress, and other symptoms of sin. But the essence is that separation from God that started with Adam and Eve. </p> <p><i>The gospel is about a relationship, not religion</i>. Sometimes a witness will ask, &ldquo;Where do you go to church?&rdquo; Or perhaps this question, &ldquo;What is your religious background.&rdquo; Frankly I have tried that approach and found it only confusing. It goes directly to whether the person is &ldquo;religious.&rdquo; And I really do not care about that. Many religious people do not know Christ. To bring up religion distracts you from the central issue of the person&rsquo;s relationship with God. </p> <p><i>The gospel calls for surrender, not just assent</i>. Paul told the Philippian jailer how to be saved, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). This is not, however, just an acknowledgement that Jesus probably lived and even that he died. It is not agreement with basic Christian views about salvation. The faith response to the gospel is a trusting surrender to Christ as Lord. It is a matter of forsaking that independent spirit and yielding to Christ in all things.</p> <p><b>Story to Story</b></p> <p>The <i>three-story</i> witness takes your neighbor as she is. It begins with her story while you ask questions, listen and learn. Then you can move to your own story, the testimony of what God has done in your life. Though your own experience may not be the same as your friend&rsquo;s, you will find a point of contact. Finally, you can move to Jesus&rsquo; story. Not only can you tell the biblical accounts that reveal the nature of God, you will tell the story of the cross and invite your friend to trust Christ as her Savior.</p> <p>There are other stories your friend needs to hear. These are the testimonies of other believers in your church. None of us is sufficient alone to introduce a new believer to the Christian life. This is where the community of Christians passes along its culture and faith.</p> <div>Wayne McDill, Senior Professor of Preaching<br/> Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br/> Wake Forest, North Carolina</div> <br/> <hr align='left' width='33%' size='1'/> <p><a href='#_ednref1' name='_edn1'>[1]</a> <i>Effective Christian Education: A National Study of Protestant Congregations.
