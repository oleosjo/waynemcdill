	<p align='center'><b>A LISTENING EAR<br/> by Wayne McDill</b></p> <p align='left'>&ldquo;Okay, let me explain it to you,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living by my neighbor for twelve years. For all that time I have never really intended to influence him for Christ. I figured someone else would have to win him.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders slightly to admit that wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea after all. &ldquo;Through these twelve years, you see, I have been fairly faithful, on and off, to go down to the church one night a week and get a visitation assignment. I am actually pretty experienced now at going to see people I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely the problem,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I <i>know</i> Ed Carlson. Well, at least I think I do. At least we&rsquo;ve been neighbors for twelve years. But, then, to tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t <i>really</i> know him. You know what I mean? We talk about the weather, our kids, ball games, grub worms in the lawn--stuff like that. So how do I, all of a sudden now, start talking to him about spiritual things? He knows I&rsquo;m a Christian. But I&rsquo;m really not sure how much that&rsquo;s worth. It probably means no more to him than, well, we go to church Sundays, and they don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;<sup></sup></p> <p>What a delightful moment of honesty! No preaching. No every-Christian-ought-to-be-a-witness generalizations. Here was an earnest Christian layman struggling with how to open the way to being a real <i>neighbor</i> to his neighbor. &ldquo;Where do I start?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I mean, I go out of here today and try to change the level of my relationship with Ed. What do I do? Just walk up to him with a Bible and tell him he needs to be saved?&rdquo;</p> <p>The problem was clear. Most Christians have dozens of people they relate to on a surface level only. But if we are to take our responsibility for evangelism seriously we must upgrade these casual acquaintances to a level of real friendship. How do we break the ice? Where do we begin? How do we get inside a person&rsquo;s life at a deeper level-a spiritual level?</p> <p>John Kramp writes that most of us have erroneous ideas as to the outlook of secular people:<a href='#_edn1' name='_ednref1'>[1]</a> </p> <p>&middot; Non-Christians are miserable.<br/> &middot; Felt needs plague them.<br/> &middot; They struggle to build relationships.<br/> &middot; Nothing they do fills their empty lives with meaning.<br/> &middot; Aware of their sin, they run from God.<br/> &middot; They fear death and worry about eternity.</p> <p>Even if these are misconceptions about non-Christians, we can assume that unbelievers do have attitudes and values that reflect their relationship with God. They may not be interested in eternal matters. They have their lives organized without God. They don&rsquo;t feel any need for Him. They have other ways of dealing with their problems. How do we awaken an awareness of Christ? How do we get inside their thinking with the gospel?<sup></sup></p> <p>I want to give you a miracle key that unlocks another&rsquo;s life to your influence for Christ. I guarantee it to work if you use it prayerfully and sincerely. And you will find it a delightful experience. You will see your casual acquaintance in a matter of days or weeks (even minutes) become open to a conversation about Christ. The key is simple: <i>your sincere interest in your neighbor&rsquo;s personal concerns</i>. The secret is listening love. Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote in <i>Life Together</i> that the first service a Christian owes a man is to listen to him.</p> <p><b>Who Cares Anyway?</b></p> <p>There is one thing for sure about every person you will ever meet: his primary concern is himself! He has a fairly well defined set of interests that all revolve around him personally. He is very interested in his job and financial security. He cares much about personal health, about the family circle, his present possessions and his plans for the future. He may have an interest in certain hobbies such as golf or fishing. He probably has a few close friends. </p> <p>Then outside this area of personal concern every person has his &ldquo;apathy zone.&rdquo; A great universe is out there just beyond the borders of &ldquo;Self Territory.&rdquo; But he is indifferent about it. </p> <p>When a Christian witness comes along to talk to this settled unbeliever about Christ, he may find him very unresponsive. Why? The whole matter of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; may be outside the unbeliever&rsquo;s territory of personal concerns. It is in the <i>apathy</i> area-literally, the &ldquo;no-feeling&rdquo; area. He couldn&rsquo;t care less. He doesn&rsquo;t see how going to church and praying and giving his money will help him improve his life. The Christian witness is selling something; the unbeliever is just not buying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; he thinks. <sup></sup></p> <p>So every person is intensely interested in himself and his little world. Another thing: he likes <i>to talk</i> about his interests. In fact he does not like to talk about much else. It is as though each person has his own personal radio channel. He is continually broadcasting on his own channel. The programming is all about his own little world. The trouble is that people around him are broadcasting their personal concerns. Most people would much rather talk than listen, even though everyone knows that the greatest bore in the world is someone who talks incessantly about himself.</p> <p>So each of us finds himself with a dilemma. In order to talk as we wish, we must do some listening. But it&rsquo;s not really listening. It is merely <i>not talking</i><sup> </sup>long enough to give the other person a chance to broadcast. Then, just as soon as you get a chance, you jump at it. You hope the other person will stop talking and listen to you. If he&rsquo;s at all polite, he will give you a turn. After all, wouldn&rsquo;t he be rude to keep on talking after you interrupt!</p> <p>So everybody&rsquo;s broadcasting on the channel of his own personal concerns. And who&rsquo;s listening? Nobody. Nobody wants to hear about that bargain you got last month at the Sears half-price sale. Who cares about your cholesterol count? Who wants to see pictures of your grandchildren? Who wants to look at your house plans? Who wants to see slides of your trip to Hawaii? Who cares? Nobody. Right? Well, almost nobody. Nobody except your few closest, best-loved, long-time, devoted friends and relatives. You hope! </p> <p><b>Learning to Listen</b></p> <p>Taylor Caldwell&rsquo;s novel, <i>The Listener</i>, tells of a listening pavilion set up in a city park. Here were booths where people could talk to the unseen &ldquo;listener.&rdquo; Here they could bare their secret souls. Here they could confess, complain, boast and dream without worrying what someone would think. What a dramatic change came in their lives when people could openly and freely talk to a sympathetic &ldquo;listener.&rdquo; Everyone needs someone who cares enough to listen to him. </p> <p>Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s great contribution to psychotherapy was not Psychoanalysis, but what he called &ldquo;The Talking Cure.&rdquo; One of his early patients told him that she thought it would help her immensely if she could just tell him what was on her mind. He listened and her neuroses went away. </p> <p>In a world where so few listen with sincere interest in another, how blessed is the one who finds a genuine listener! For a Christian seeking a way into another&rsquo;s life, here is the key. Sincere listening says eloquently, &ldquo;I care about you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a matter of deliberately switching &ldquo;channels&rdquo; to guide the conversation into the area of the other person&rsquo;s interests. It means forfeiting the right to talk about yourself. It means cultivating listening skills--looking your friend in the eye, paying attention to what he says, asking pertinent questions, nodding, smiling, commenting briefly.</p> <p>Switching &ldquo;channels&rdquo; has a remarkable effect. Your conversation partner immediately senses the difference. A high-school student tried this conversational channel-switching as an experiment. One day on campus, he stood in a huddle of four or five boys. One in the group talked more than any of the others. The boys were obviously more interested in girls strolling by than in the talker. Our experimenter deliberately tuned to the talkative boy&rsquo;s channel and started paying real attention. Within seconds the talker sensed it. He began directing his remarks to the only one really listening.</p> <p>You can develop listening skills. Try it during coffee breaks, or at lunch, or over the back fence. Watch how listening changes the conversation. Two rather amazing things happen. For one thing, the Christian learns a lot about his friend--his attitudes, priorities, strengths, hurts and fears. All this helps him know how to pray for him and relate to him. But a second thing also happens: the listening Christian becomes very special to the unbeliever. He has found a friend! For what is a friend if not someone who genuinely cares?</p> <p>In light of this remarkable response to sincere listening, I am rather perplexed at the instructions of some witnessing courses. They actually <i>discourage</i> listening to the unbeliever. Since a specific memorized presentation is used, the witness is told he should not allow himself to be distracted by the responses of the unbeliever. He is instructed just to wait until the unbeliever finishes his comment and then proceed with his presentation, regardless of what was said. This is actually training in how <i>not</i> to listen.</p> <p>Even in the briefest contact, listening is never out of order. Some witnesses have told me they have actually felt <i>guilty</i> for listening. They feel the compulsion to be getting their witness across and so fulfilling their responsibility. Paul Little laughs at his own early witnessing attempts before he learned the lesson of actually <i>communicating</i> with people on a two-way basis:</p> <p>About every six months the pressure to witness used to reach explosive heights inside me. Not knowing any better, I would suddenly lunge at someone and spout all my verses with a sort of glazed stare in my eye. I honestly didn&rsquo;t expect any response. As soon as my victim indicated lack of interest, I&rsquo;d begin to edge away from him with a sigh of relief and the consoling thought, &ldquo;All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution&rdquo; (2 Tim. 3:12).<a href='#_edn2' name='_ednref2'>[2]</a> <sup></sup></p> <p><sup></sup></p> <p>Many of us would have to confess a similar experience. In this approach to witnessing, the unbeliever is little more than a target for our words. </p> <p>As the relationship develops the friend who has sensed your genuine interest will feel much more free to be himself. Only then will he share very personal needs and problems. He will also be more likely to listen to you. You have won his confidence with sincere friendship. When he feels the need to talk seriously with someone, where will he turn? It will be to the one who listens sympathetically and apparently has his best interests at heart. This kind of relationship obviously gives the Christian a wide-open opportunity to have a strong influence for Christ in his friend&rsquo;s life.</p> <p><b>Developing Listening Skills</b></p> <p>Listening involves much more than just hearing the sound of words. Your ears only qualify you physically as a listener. Think a moment: how do you know when someone is really listening to you? You pick up clues that tell you that you have a listener. And those clues even tell you the level of the listening. As a preacher I learned early that people have the ability to park their bodies in a church pew and leave the meeting. That can also happen in personal conversation. Let&rsquo;s explore some skills a witness can develop, as he becomes a real listener.</p> <p>The first listening skill is an <i>attitude</i> of genuine interest. You are not playing a part; you actually want to hear what is being said. You want to discover what you can about this unique person before you. Sincere interest in others will help you put out of your mind all those self-directed concerns that keep trying to force their way to the forefront of your thinking. You are listening because you <i>want</i> to, not for your own benefit, but for the good of your neighbor. You want to get inside his outlook and understand him, feel with him in his hurts and sense his need for Christ.</p> <p>How will your neighbor know if you listening with genuine interest? One simple way is <i>eye contact</i>. Do you look him in the eye or gaze off in search of something more interesting to think about? You have probably noticed this in others. They may appear bored until you say something of interest. Then they immediately look you in the eye to fasten on what is being said. When someone looks into the eyes of the person talking, he sends an &ldquo;instant message&rdquo; that say&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo; This encourages the speaker to move on to more meaningful subjects. Someone said long ago that the eyes are the windows of the soul. The signals you can see in your friend&rsquo;s eyes will tell you a lot about him--his attitude, his hurts, his worries, his receptivity. </p> <p><i>Facial expressions</i> also relay the listener&rsquo;s interest. A person really listening will reflect in his face the things he hears. We used to be amused at my dad. He would become intensely interested in a television drama. Then his face would reflect every action. An expression may say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disgusted.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I disapprove.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I understand, I sympathize, I care.&rdquo; Check your face in a mirror. Is it saying what you think it says? You may think you are smiling broadly while your face reveals only a hint of pleasantness.</p> <p><i>Gestures</i> and other body language also reveal the degree to which you are listening. The one speaking may not say to himself: &ldquo;Hum! This guy has his shoulder pointed my way more than his face.&rdquo; But unconsciously he receives a message that you are not in this conversation. He will sense how you are responding to him. In <i>How to Read a Person like a Book</i>, the authors write that some of your gestures may be normal to you, but communicate what you do not intend.<a href='#_edn3' name='_ednref3'>[3]</a> Becoming alert to the usual meaning of certain gestures and posture will help you be a sincere listener with more than just your ears.</p> <p>You also show whether you are really listening by your <i>responses</i> to your friend. A good listener will respond at appropriate times. It may be a nod, a laugh, a question for clarification. But that comment or response must follow the flow of the conversation. Did you ever find yourself in a one-way telephone conversation? You think you are really connected with your friend on the other end of the line. Then your friend jolts you with a disjointed remark from a distant galaxy. How did you feel when you discovered you were the only one in on this conversation? When one person comments just to be commenting the dialogue is over. Simply asking questions is not a sure sign of genuine interest. Your question must show that you are actually into the train of thought with your friend. </p> <p>Be alert and you will communicate care and earn trust. Remember that your attitude is the key. When you choose to listen because you genuinely care, your body language shows it. Your gestures and facial expressions as well as your comments will reflect caring. The more alert you are to these non-verbal messages, the more you can avoid sending false signals. The big message is that you are actually <i>listening</i>. You are resisting the temptation to dominate the conversation with your own personal concerns. Such listening speaks profoundly.</p> <p><b>Starved for Attention</b></p> <p>Psychologist Charles Derber has written that most of us are suffering <i>attention starvation.</i><a href='#_edn4' name='_ednref4'>[4]</a> Our fast paced contemporary lifestyle is nothing like the front porch leisure of a hundred years ago. Two income families struggle to have a meal together. The husband doesn&rsquo;t really have time for his wife, nor she for him. And the children seem to be on their own. They may have everything but the attention they crave most of all.</p> <p>A child will often be willing to misbehave and get a negative response in order to get some response. Among youth that pattern continues, but it becomes more serious. To get the attention of their peers, young people will do whatever it takes. If they do not have a strong system of moral convictions, they will follow the crowd anywhere. Psychologist Kenneth Pepper quoted a juvenile delinquent saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to be wanted by the police than not to be wanted at all.&rdquo;<a href='#_edn5' name='_ednref5'>[5]</a> </p> <p>Abraham Maslow developed a system of psychology based on seven broad classes of human needs. These he arranged into a hierarchy starting with basic needs such as hunger and thirst and moving up the scale to aesthetic needs-the craving to experience beauty. Food and shelter are only on our minds if they are lacking. If we are fed and sheltered we become conscious of more significant needs such as achievement, companionship, and self-expression. Maslow helped us understand that a person is an attention-seeking individual.<a href='#_edn6' name='_ednref6'>[6]</a> </p> <p>Positive attention from others tells me I am worthwhile as a person. To be ignored is distressing. No one wants to be a nobody. You can remember how the attention you got as a child, or the lack of it, shaped your own sense of value as a person.</p> <p>Robert Rosenthal has called the effect others&rsquo; expectations have on us the <i>Pygmalion Effect</i>. He reported on experiments in which teachers were told that randomly selected children were highly gifted. The attention the teachers gave those children caused them to excel, even though they were actually no more gifted than others in the class. In the same way, your positive estimate of another person, communicated by the attention and affirmation you give him, tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy in his life.</p> <p>There is another benefit of positive attention from others: it gives a person an opportunity to express himself. Self-expression is a serious need everyone has. Someone listens to you while you express your thoughts and feelings. It&rsquo;s like finding an oasis in a hot dry desert! Refreshment! It encourages a person to keep going. So, the better you listen, the more your friend will say. And the more you will learn of his story.</p> <p><b>Listening to Learn</b></p> <p>So now you have determined to switch channels and listen to your neighbor. What can you learn? As we noted, every person is continually broadcasting on her own channel. And the subject of the program is her own personal concerns. When you listen with sincere interest in her, you will find her being more and more open to you about her life. You will learn more than you ever expected.</p> <p>But there is more to this kind of listening than just maintaining eye contact. It&rsquo;s not just showing your interest. You need to make mental notes about what you hear. You must think about what you are hearing. For example, your friend might talk about a stressful situation at work or a strong willed preschooler. You will soon have a file on her in your own mind and in your prayer journal. You listen, you learn. The more you learn, the more effective your witness to her will be.</p> <p>Most people will talk about their <i>background</i>. This personal history is her story. (Or &ldquo;his-story&rdquo;.) She has a hometown somewhere. Her parents left their mark on her life, some for good, some not. She was a high school student. She will tell you about her cheerleader tryouts. She may talk about the boy she dated for so long. Perhaps you will hear about the job she took after graduation.</p> <p>She will tell you, as she learns to trust a listening friend, about her <i>marriage and family</i>. Or if she is single, about the times she came close to being married. Women are more likely to talk about their marriages and the stresses they experience than men are. But the home and family is always a subject of the conversation at some time. </p> <p>Another subject that will come up is <i>work</i>. Men are especially likely to tell you about their work; most men define themselves largely in terms of their jobs. You do not even have to understand what they do to ask questions and learn something about it. </p> <p><i>Recreation</i> is a common subject. We all like to talk about what we do for fun. You will find out that he is a fisherman or a hunter. Or he does woodworking, or gardens, or collects rare coins. Whatever his hobbies, here is an open door for getting better acquainted. You may find that you have an interest in common. And you may find that you can learn something about his specialty. Everyone likes to teach what he knows.</p> <p>Most of us usually get around to the subject of <i>health</i> also. Your friend may tell you about her new diet, her exercise program, or even her struggle with diabetes. We are all concerned about our health. And we are delighted when someone else will listen to us tell about it. </p> <p>We also like to talk about our <i>stuff.</i> Your friend may want you to see her house, especially the room she recently redecorated. He may want to talk about cars with you, or lawn equipment, or tools of some other kind. You may not be impressed with your friend&rsquo;s house or furniture or car. But he wants to talk about them, and you care about him.</p> <p><b>Reading between the Lines</b></p> <p>So why is it important to listen to all this? Aren&rsquo;t these subjects irrelevant to the gospel and a person&rsquo;s salvation? Maybe. But it is his life. And as you listen to his story you will learn what his values are. You will discover how he spends his time. And you will find what he counts on for fulfillment. You will learn what is really important to him. This is what he thinks gives meaning to his life. And all of that will prepare you better to share with him what is most important of all, a vital relationship with Christ.</p> <p>Of course it is not necessary to wait until you have a complete file on your friend to witness to him. You will be sharing all along the way. To the degree that he is receptive and the relationship will bear it, you will share you faith. Then there will come a time when your prayers will be answered: the opening will come for putting his faith in Christ.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s think again about the subjects people like to talk about and how what they say can reveal very personal needs.</p> <p>A person&rsquo;s <i>background</i> can be an interesting story. It may also hold some hidden pain and bitterness. As you get to know your friend better, the story takes on depth and color that did not come out at first. Every <i>marriage and family</i> has the potential for trouble. One day a call may come, &ldquo;Karen, I just had to talk to someone, and you are a real friend. Can I come over?&rdquo; Then over a cup of coffee she tells you that her husband is asking for a divorce. </p> <p>There is no area of personal concern without the potential for personal pain. &ldquo;They are laying off over a hundred people next week, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I will be cut.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I just came back from the doctor&rsquo;s office. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do. He said its cancer.&rdquo;</p> <p>Carl Kromminga writes that when your neighbor begins to speak more openly of his own fears and insecurities, careful and earnest listening becomes all the more important.</p> <p>It is necessary<sup> </sup>for the Christian to enter fully and deeply into what the non-believer is saying. He must somehow stand inside his neighbor. He must try to stand in the neighbor&rsquo;s place and feel his intentions. He must strive for full empathy. Only in this way can he begin to make connections between the deepest need of the neighbor and the answer of the gospel.<a href='#_edn7' name='_ednref7'>[7]</a> </p> <p>It won&rsquo;t always take a crisis to bring a person to Christ, but you can be sure your friend will be more receptive when trouble comes. If you have been a good listener, you will be the one she calls when she needs to talk. You are the one who cares. You are the one who can be trusted. And even if your friend doesn&rsquo;t realize it, you are the one with the ultimate answer.</p> <p><b>A Listening Lifeline</b></p> <p>As you befriend those in your world, you may find some who are very much unlike yourself. You may find some struggling with bondages that even shock you. One man I worked with came to me one day to confess that he was plagued with homosexual temptation. We talked after that from time to time. He described his bondage more graphically than I needed to hear. This perverted passion dominated his life. He was unable to overcome it.</p> <p>But he learned he could trust me. We met week after week to talk and pray together. Eventually he trusted Christ. God gave him a release from the chains that bound him. I realized early in our friendship that he didn&rsquo;t have anyone else he could trust. Our conversations were like a lifeline for a drowning man. He told me he lived from one meeting to the next. I never intended to get so involved or to be such a necessary support for him. That is part of the risk of being an agent for Christ.</p> <p>A few months and our paths parted. Then, years later in another city this man came up to me at a conference and greeted me warmly. At first, I didn&rsquo;t remember. But he reminded me where we knew each other: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one you helped. I know you remember.&rdquo; Then he proudly introduced me to his wife and children. It was a moment I will never forget. </p> <p>In that moment the hours I spent listening to that tortured friend were worth it all. I wish I could say that every person I have tried to influence for Christ experienced such a victory. Sometimes this process of making friends for Christ leaves us disappointed. Nevertheless, it is our task to tune to the channel of our friend. Then we give him the positive attention God&rsquo;s love for him requires. What comes of that investment is not ours to measure.</p> <p>It is obvious that listening to your neighbor will open his heart to you. There may be barriers in the relationship, however, that will hinder your influence with him. Until these barriers are removed, the door will be closed to your witness. In the next chapter we will examine some of the most common barriers to our influence and learn how do deal with them.</p> <div>Wayne McDill, Senior Professor of Preaching<br/> Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br/> Wake Forest, North Carolina</div> <br/> <hr align='left' width='33%' size='1'/> <p><a href='#_ednref1' name='_edn1'>[1]</a> John Kramp, <i>Out of Their Faces and into Their Shoes</i>, (Nashville: Broadman &amp; Holman, 1995), p. 9.</p> <p><a href='#_ednref2' name='_edn2'>[2]</a> Paul E.
