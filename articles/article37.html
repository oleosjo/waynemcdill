I really enjoyed your description of the visit with Miss Irene.&nbsp; It is amazing that she is still so active in the church at her age.&nbsp; Taking Dana and the baby with you was a very good idea.&nbsp; Older people really enjoy babies and children.&nbsp; I used to take Anna with me to the nursing home when she was four or five.&nbsp; We never struggled for something to talk about when she was with me.&nbsp; And she enjoyed being the center of attention with the ones we visited.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building loving relationships with your people is the best way to begin your pastorate.&nbsp; Through the generations pastors have learned that the one thing the people respond to best is when the pastor really loves them.&nbsp; No matter how well he preaches or how effective his leadership, there is no substitute for a warm and caring attitude toward the people.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned that being a pastor has made you more aware of the need to pay attention to those around you.&nbsp; You said you might pass another person before with your head down and your mind on other matters.&nbsp; But now you are the shepherd.&nbsp; Sheep are your business.&nbsp; You represent the Good Shepherd, who was always attentive to the needs of those he met.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess we should all be intentionally loving as Christians, whether we are pastors or not.&nbsp; But that is not an easy assignment.&nbsp; We do have other things on our minds.&nbsp; Sometimes the people around us seem to distract us from the real business of what we are trying to accomplish, whether it is shopping for groceries or studying for a sermon.&nbsp; Besides that, some people are hard to love, even hard to like.&nbsp; They are so selfish, so immature, so irritating.&nbsp; Our natural reaction is to withdraw and put some distance between them and ourselves.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time we are not warm and caring toward others because we do not feel like it.&nbsp; Our understanding of love is very much wrapped up with emotion.&nbsp; If we try to act loving when we don&#039;t feel like it, that may even seem a bit hypocritical.&nbsp; But this view of love will never stand the test of Scripture.&nbsp; The New Testament uses the word <i>agape</i> for Christian love.&nbsp; This is an attitude of self-giving not attached to emotion in which you actively seek the good of the person before you.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian love is more connected with volition than emotion.&nbsp; Whether we feel like it or not, we can choose to release God&#039;s love for the other person because 'the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit' (Rom 5.5).&nbsp; We can love by faith.&nbsp; So it is not a matter of my coming up with the love I need to relate to others.&nbsp; The love is already there, brought to me by the Spirit.&nbsp; It is the love of God that I can express, whether I feel like it or not (1 John 4.7).</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does this love behave?&nbsp; Let me suggest four strategies of love, beginning with the most casual relationship and moving to the most costly.&nbsp; We can express God&#039;s love through the way we relate to others, no matter whether we hardly know them or are intimately related.&nbsp; The four strategies of love define the attitude and behavior we use with others that best releases the love of God: <i>acknowledgment</i>, <i>acceptance</i>,<i> affirmation</i>, and <i>atonement.</i></div> <div><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acknowledging</i> others is simply a smile and greeting that says, 'I see you there as a person whom God loves.'&nbsp; The posture for this strategy might be a hand uplifted in a wave.&nbsp; This may not sound very taxing as an expression of love.&nbsp; But just think of all the people you might pass by in a day without a greeting, if you did not plan on it.&nbsp; Acknowledging another person with a smile and nod, whether in the convenience store or in the church auditorium, makes a relational connection with that person.&nbsp; It says you are taking notice of her as a person.&nbsp; Even with strangers you can develop the habit of noticing and acknowledging their presence. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making eye contact, smiling and saying 'Hello' to strangers may seem out of place to some people.&nbsp; This depends, of course, on where you live and what the local customs are.&nbsp; When we moved from Oregon to North Carolina I was soon struck with the difference in the way people acknowledged each other on the street or in a store.&nbsp; In Oregon most people did not make eye contact and so avoided any acknowledgment at all.&nbsp; In small town North Carolina, everyone waves and greets whomever they meet.&nbsp; I joked about being tired of waving at everyone when we first moved here.&nbsp; Though this is just a Southern custom, it is a good one.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second strategy moves closer in the relationship.&nbsp; It is <i>acceptance</i>.&nbsp; This means you communicate to the other person by your words and actions that you accept him just as he is.&nbsp; You do not have some requirements he must meet before you will relate positively to him.&nbsp; The posture for this strategy could be the open arms of a welcome.&nbsp; In a sense you are welcoming the other person into your life.&nbsp; Just as Jesus invited Zacchaeus to come down from the tree, you are inviting the other person to step inside your fellowship circle.&nbsp; Even Zacchaeus&#039; sin did not cause Jesus to reject him.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people may be hard to accept.&nbsp; Their manner, their grooming, their clothing, their habits, their attitude--all these factors may put you off and cause you to reject them as not meeting your expectations.&nbsp; If you accept another person in spite of these irritants you will have to go against your own inclinations.&nbsp; But you can act in faith because you know the love of God is available to you.&nbsp; Instead of moving away from the person you do not like, you can move toward him in faith.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third strategy for love is <i>affirmation</i>.&nbsp; Just as Jesus affirmed Zacchaeus by going to his home, you can affirm the people around you.&nbsp; Affirmation is a 'yes' to the other person, an endorsement of him or her.&nbsp; The gesture for this strategy may be an arm around the shoulders as you walk together into his world.&nbsp; Just as <i>acceptance</i> invites another person into your world, <i>affirmation</i> says you are comfortable in his.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter who the person is, he is made in the image of God and Christ died for him, so he is valuable beyond measure.&nbsp; Your affirmation channels the love of God to him and expresses your estimate of his great worth.&nbsp; This is the missionary strategy--going to where the people are in their own world and being with them there.&nbsp; This very strategy brought Jesus a lot of criticism because he 'ate with sinners and tax collectors.'&nbsp; Can we do less than our Lord in expressing his love to others?</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth strategy is <i>atonement</i>.&nbsp; This means you are ready to make whatever sacrifices are needed channel God&#039;s love to the other person.&nbsp; The model for this strategy also is Jesus as he dealt with Zacchaeus.&nbsp; After Zacchaeus expressed his repentance, Jesus said, 'The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost' (Luke 19.10).&nbsp; Jesus&#039; mission of love was to give his life for the salvation of others.&nbsp; His atonement meant that he was the atoning sacrifice for others, removing the barrier of sin that separated them from God.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atonement for us, of course, does not mean we can die for the sins of others.&nbsp; Jesus is unique in that role.&nbsp; But we are to bear the cross as we follow Him.&nbsp; Defining what it means to bear the cross has been confusing to many Christians.&nbsp; The cross meant for Jesus intentional vicarious redemptive sacrifice.&nbsp; That is also the cross for us.&nbsp; It is <i>intentional</i>, our determined plan for ministry.&nbsp; It is <i>vicarious</i>, in behalf of others.&nbsp; It is <i>redemptive</i>, setting others free from bondage.&nbsp; It is <i>sacrifice</i>, giving of yourself for another&rsquo;s benefit.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes you may have to give up your own wants for another&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp; Or you may have to give up your needs for his needs.&nbsp; Or you may even find it necessary to give up your needs for his wants.&nbsp; As the Lord directs you, you will discover that as you follow this strategy of self-giving, you will always have His grace and resources for everything you need.&nbsp; The posture for this strategy is arms spread wide in the pattern of the cross.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These four strategies can provide a specific plan of action for love, whatever the level of relationship.&nbsp; In <i>acknowledgment</i> you will make love&#039;s connection with the other person by a smile and greeting.&nbsp; In <i>acceptance</i> you will overlook anything about him that puts you off and receive him positively.&nbsp; In <i>affirmation</i> you will endorse his value and take God&#039;s love into his world.&nbsp; In<i> atonement</i> you will make whatever sacrifices are necessary to bring him to Christ.&nbsp; No matter how casual or costly the relationship you have with another, love is always the right strategy.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God will bless you as you continue to reach out to others in love.&nbsp; God is looking for agents of his love and grace.&nbsp; What a privilege to represent Him in that way.</div> <div>Love, </div> <div>Dad</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Wayne McDill&nbsp;
