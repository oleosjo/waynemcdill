	<p align='center'><b><i><font size='4'>Discouragement<br/> </font></i></b>from <b><u>Letters to Matthew</u></b></p> <p>Dear Matthew:</p> <p>I want to discuss today the common ailment of pastors, discouragement. I realize that now you are enthusiastic about your ministry at New Hill. It may be difficult to imagine why you might become discouraged later on. Let me play the prophet, however, and predict that the time is coming when you will experience the same discouragement other pastors do. I am not trying to be negative or suggest that you have some weakness that has yet to show up. It just seems better to understand discouragement ahead of time so that when it comes you will be prepared to deal with it.</p> <p>The word 'discouragement' means, at its root, a failure of courage. That seems to relate it to the idea of fear. We commonly use terms like 'lose heart' to describe this emotion. It is the sense that what matters to you is not working out as it should. In the case of the pastor, he has the feeling that his ministry is failing, that no progress is being made, that his best efforts and plans are to no avail. It is a fear of failure in the thing that matters most to him, his calling.</p> <p>A pastor naturally measures the success of his ministry by what is taking place in his church. If he can see attendance increasing, people trusting Christ, finances coming up, some program coming off as a success, he feels that his work is going well and he is not discouraged. His preaching is a key element in the measure of his ministry. If he is enjoying the preaching, has a good plan for the weeks to come, and is getting good feedback from the people about his sermons, he feels very positive about his ministry.</p> <p>Tying his sense of success in the ministry to the work of the church also brings on discouragement. Any of the factors I mentioned just now can seem to be negative indicators of his effectiveness. Attendance down, no professions of faith, finances weak, preaching flat--here is a guaranteed formula for discouragement. As I have said, at the root it is a fear of failure in the thing that matters most to you, your ministry.</p> <p>Many a pastor has blamed his discouragement on his congregation. 'If I only had a better church,' he reasons, 'I could see the results I want. But these people are so apathetic and self-centered. They have no interest in the work of the kingdom. No matter what I do, they just sit there and watch. I don&#039;t know what to do to get them to wake up, get up, and do something for God. Maybe God is through with me here. Maybe it is time to move on.'</p> <p>I can certainly understand that attitude. I have been there before. Being pastor of a church means you take everything that happens in the church as a reflection on you. Remember how Moses felt as he tried to shepherd the people of Israel. Their obstinance and rebellion often had him crying out to God to be relieved of the job. Being shepherd of a flock like that is no picnic. </p> <p>Discouragement can be a downward spiral of hopelessness that feeds on itself. A sermon seems to flop. So the pastor goes home deflated after the service. He blames himself, admitting that he did not prepare as well as he should. Then he starts to feel sorry for himself and tells himself he is just not up to this job. He can&#039;t preach. He is not a good leader. He makes too many mistakes. As his gloom spreads he thinks of other evidence of his inadequacy so that this line of thought makes him even more discouraged.</p> <p>What is needed at that point is a reality check. We do not deal with our circumstances in terms of their reality, but in terms of our interpretation of them. So now you must carefully and honestly separate your present interpretation from the reality of your situation. Is your negative viewpoint the only way to look at your church? Is your gloom painting the picture in darker hues than are warranted? Can you also give a positive interpretation that sees other factors and comes to a different conclusion?</p> <p>Keeping a journal is very helpful at this point. I used to do a writing exercise when I knew my interpretation was colored more my by attitude than by the facts. First I would write out how things looked to me at the moment. Sparing none of the details, I would tell the story in all its weary despair. That interpretation would be entitled, 'How I feel about my ministry now.' Then I would write another interpretation entitled, 'How God sees my ministry now.' For this version I would draw on my knowledge of who God is and what He is doing, His promises and His ways with His people. Without fail the two versions would be remarkably different.</p> <p>This exercise accomplished several things for me. For one thing it allowed me to get on paper the negative train of thought I was pursuing. I did not deny this interpretation; I gave it full expression. The exercise also allowed me intentionally to shift direction and look at the situation from another perspective, the viewpoint of faith. Of course I could do that without the writing, but the exercise really helped me focus my thoughts and see my interpretation for what it was.</p> <p>There may be times when anyone you know might agree with you that you have reason to be discouraged. The facts of the case may indicate that the ministry of the church is floundering. At this point let your discouragement motivate you to seek the Lord. Call on church leaders to seek Him. Perhaps a time of fasting and prayer will cause the whole congregation to see the ministry from God&#039;s viewpoint. This is much better than playing the blame game in which you and your people try to find a scapegoat for the lack of progress.</p> <p>Discouragement is directly related to expectations. It is difficult to become discouraged when you do not expect anything. But when you hope for some results that do not come, discouragement will rear his gloomy head. This being true, it is good to examine your expectations. What do you hope for? Is it reasonable? Is it tied to some program or event or to God&#039;s provision? Are you expecting great surges of advance for the church when a little progress at a time would be better? Are your expectations reasonable at this stage in the life of the church? Are they clearly what God wants to do?</p> <p>Young pastors tend to be in a hurry. When you go to a new pastorate, you can immediately see all sorts of improvements that could be made. You are convinced that in no time the attendance will increase, that you will win some of these unchurched folk to the Lord, that your enthusiasm and faith will be contagious so that the congregation will rise up and go to work for God. That zeal is good. Those expectations are exciting. They may also be in the right direction. But to realize them may take longer than you think. Like a mountain on the horizon, the results you envision may seem much closer than they are.</p> <p>In taking a hard look at your expectations, you are back to an effort at rational and objective thinking, without the emotion that gets confused about the facts. Thinking objectively is not easy. This is where good friends in the ministry can help. As I have mentioned, you need to have peers you can talk with as well as mentors you can consult. Just talking it out can help. But hearing what others have to say can help as well. Remember, interpretation is our guide for dealing with our reality. Good friends can help construct an interpretation that is biblical and true to the facts.</p> <p>Discouragement in the ministry can lead to burnout. That is a condition in which you are spiritually and emotionally exhausted and can no longer function effectively. Pastors experience burnout when they keep working and striving for results that do not come until their discouragement causes them to lose hope and finally give up. </p> <p>The discouragement spiral is a test of your faith. The issue is clear. Will you trust God to give fruit for your labor? Will you trust the timetable to him? Will you see apparent failure as a call to seek His face? Will you allow Him to minister to you through others, in your church and beyond? Will you let Him guide you through His Word instead of following a secular model for your work? </p> <p>Occasional discouragement is a natural human response to unrealized hopes and goals. But faith can dispel the gloom when you allow it to interpret your situation in light of God&#039;s love and provision. Listen to the psalmist in Psalm 42.11. </p> <blockquote dir='ltr' style='MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px'> <p>Why are you cast down, O my soul?<br/> And why are you disquieted within me?<br/> Hope in God; <br/> For I shall yet praise Him,<br/> The help of my countenance <br/> and my God.</p> </blockquote> <p>This may seem to be a rather tiresome subject at this point in your ministry at New Hill. But discouragement is just as much a part of the ministry as praise and joy. You will come back and read these paragraphs some day. I hope they are helpful. </p> <p>And remember that I am always ready to help you see your work from the viewpoint of faith.</p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Dad<br/> <br/> Wayne McDill, Senior Professor of Preaching<br/> Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br/> Wake Forest, North Carolina</p>	</td>
