	<div align='center'><b><i><font size='5'>Your Place in History</font></i></b></div> <div align='center'><b>from <i>Letters to Matthew</i></b></div> <div><font size='4'>&nbsp;</font></div> <div>Dear Matthew:</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congratulations on your first pastorate!&nbsp; What a wonderful privilege it is to be called by God to shepherd his people.&nbsp; And what an awesome responsibility.&nbsp; There is no assignment on earth to compare with being pastor of the humblest church.&nbsp; Though it is small, New Hill Baptist has a long and fruitful history.&nbsp; I believe you said it was established in 1888.&nbsp; Just think of that.&nbsp; Well over a hundred years that congregation has worshipped and served in that community without a break.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now here you come, born just 25 years ago.&nbsp; The founding members of this church lived through the Civil War.&nbsp; You can&#039;t even remember Viet Nam.&nbsp; I am not saying this to put you down.&nbsp; You were born in God&#039;s good time.&nbsp; And this is your day.&nbsp; This is your generation.&nbsp; The future lies open to you with the promise of all that you can do by the grace of God.&nbsp; I have heard it said that every person&#039;s view of history begins with his own birth.&nbsp; So let me push back your sense of history and think of New Hill Baptist Church in terms of its historical scope.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This church was established in the waning years of the Reconstruction era, as the South was trying to recover after the devastation of the war.&nbsp; The war was just over twenty years in the past when that small group met to organize a new Baptist Church in the New Hill community.&nbsp; Though I do not know the history of the New Hill church specifically, we can guess at its beginnings until you can find out the facts.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those years after the war, Churches segregated as newly free Blacks pulled out of their balcony pews in white churches and established their own congregations with their own pastors, often with the blessing and help of the mother churches.&nbsp; There was still a lot of bitterness on the part of white and black, over slavery and over the destruction of the war.&nbsp; But Christians tried to work together as they could.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is now old Highway 1, just off the front steps of your church building, was probably a dirt track then, but still the main road between the capital city of Raleigh and the South Carolina capital of Columbia.&nbsp; New Hill would have been a much more self-contained community then, some twenty miles from Raleigh, a long drive seldom made by residents then.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The automobile was just an idea in the workshop of unknown inventors.&nbsp; Saddle horses and various kinds of wagons and buggies provided transport for shorter distances.&nbsp; Steam power was the basis for rail transportation that linked the whole of the United States.&nbsp; Steam paddle wheelers hauled freight and passengers on the waterways of the country.&nbsp; Many of the textile mills of North Carolina were run by steam.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication was by mail or telegraph.&nbsp; Radio was still in experiments and television was a distant dream.&nbsp; Newspapers were widely read, even old issues.&nbsp; The politics of the day included the continual wrangling over a future for the South after reconstruction.&nbsp; With the state capital so close, the people of New Hill would have kept themselves informed about the issues of the day.&nbsp; They would have been particularly interested in the tobacco markets, since that was the chief crop in the region.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With some imagination you can picture that first meeting of a few dedicated Baptists wanting to start a new church.&nbsp; The several men and a few women met at the home of one of the farmers in the community.&nbsp; They all arrived on horseback or in buggies or farm wagons.&nbsp; They talked about the need for a Baptist church in the area, about where they might meet, about who they might get to come and preach.&nbsp; Someone suggested they pray, so the men got to their knees and asked the blessings of the Almighty on their efforts.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had no idea that their fledgling church would still be meeting in 1999.&nbsp; They would probably have doubted the world would ever continue to that date.&nbsp; Surely the Lord would return before that time and judgment would come on this miserable and wicked world.&nbsp; As they constructed the building, they had no idea it would still be standing so long.&nbsp; They were approaching the beginning of the new twentieth century.&nbsp; And now you have come to the church at the dawn of the twenty-first.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that simple beginning until now, several generations have come and gone.&nbsp; A tour through the graveyard behind the church will tell a bit of their story.&nbsp; Many times have the members of New Hill Church gathered around an open grave in that cemetery and wept over the loss of some beloved grandparent or child, husband or son, while the minister, one of your predecessors, read a passage like John 11:25, 26: 'I am the resurrection and the life.&nbsp; He who believes in Me, though may die, he shall live.&nbsp; And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die.'</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great inventions, great wars, earthshaking events from around the globe--none have kept that small congregation from meeting every Sunday morning to sing the old songs and hear the Word of God preached.&nbsp; Even now, some of the songs are the same.&nbsp; And the Bible is the same.&nbsp; They used the King James Bible for most of those years and now you preach from the New King James.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They joyously made their way to the river for baptism on those special Sundays in the spring and summer.&nbsp; Then, after the river was dammed up to form Jordan Lake, they baptized in the lake.&nbsp; Now they have moved to the swimming pool of one of the families.&nbsp; But the idea of coming to Christ as Savior is the same.&nbsp; The forgiveness of sins is the same.&nbsp; And the same words may be used as the minister lifts his hand, 'Upon your profession of faith in Jesus Christ, I baptize you, my brother, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Buried with Christ in baptism; raised to walk in the newness of life.&nbsp; Amen.'</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To you now, coming as a new pastor to the church, all those stories are unknown.&nbsp; The struggles they endured, the tears they cried, the songs they sang, the sermons they heard have all passed out of sight and hearing.&nbsp; They are gone and you will never know them in this life.&nbsp; But to God they are yet present before him.&nbsp; The whole history of this little church is at once real and present to Him who is beyond time and its corruption. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now you join that company of church members and pastors who have called New Hill their home.&nbsp; The technology of your automobile and your microwave do not make you different from any of them.&nbsp; All those pastors struggled over worn Bibles to put a sermon together for Sunday.&nbsp; They prayed for the Spirit of God to move in the service, for the power to fall, for the lost to be saved and the saved revived.&nbsp; You are one with them.&nbsp; They are your brothers, all standing before God as you take your place with them.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So God did not come to New Hill when you arrived.&nbsp; Neither did serious devotion to Christ.&nbsp; I know the community is small and there is not much left of what once was.&nbsp; I know the church is small and that the members can look back to better days.&nbsp; But the great cloud of witnesses from the past hundred years surrounds you to testify to the power and grace of God.&nbsp; Though time separates you from them, they are your brothers and sisters in the Lord.&nbsp; They are your partners in this work.&nbsp; They have sowed and you will reap.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would tell you, if you could hear, of the time when real revival came to the church and the meetings went on for every night for more than three weeks.&nbsp; They would tell you of the time when the town drunk was saved and how his family rejoiced.&nbsp; They would tell you of unforgettable sermons about the one lost sheep, about the witnesses at the foot of the cross, about the garden of Eden and the serpent&#039;s lies.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would tell you about dinner on the grounds with fried chicken, and green beans and sweet potatoes and rhubarb pie.&nbsp; They would tell you about Gospel sings under a brush tabernacle in the summertime.&nbsp; They would tell you about the young people God called to missions from New Hill who served in far away Brazil or Kenya.&nbsp; They would tell you about the war years when they prayed for those in uniform and had sad memorial services for those who were buried in European battlefields.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What difference does all this make?&nbsp; God has been the living Lord through all this history.&nbsp; All those who have gone before you are brothers with you now.&nbsp; You have not come for something new to begin with your arrival.&nbsp; God is already at work at New Hill.&nbsp; He has brought you to this place for such a time as this, for a work He intends to do.&nbsp; And you will join that long procession into the silence of the past.&nbsp; This is your moment.&nbsp; Give it your best, and the best God will give you.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn all you can of the history of your church and community.&nbsp; Ask questions and rejoice in the blessings of God in days past.&nbsp; Get a sense of the sweep of His-story in that place.&nbsp; An understanding of our history helps us interpret the present and prepare for the future.&nbsp; I am eager to hear the real story of New Hill Church, but I will predict that my imaginings are not far from the mark.&nbsp; Let me know. </div> <div>Love, </div> <div>Dad</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Wayne McDill</div> <div>Senior Professor of Preaching</div> <div>Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</div> <div><a href='http://www.waynemcdill.net/'>http://www.waynemcdill.net</a></div> <div>&nbsp;</div>	</td>
