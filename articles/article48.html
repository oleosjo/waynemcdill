I happened to go by the local library recently during &ldquo;Story Time.&rdquo;<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Some twenty or thirty preschoolers were there with their mothers and some fathers.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>These adults were trying to herd them into a bunch and get them seated on the floor near the woman who was to read to them.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>She sat down and opened an oversized children&rsquo;s book.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The little people were chattering, wiggling, poking, and some whimpering.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Then she began to read.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very soon the children became quiet and still.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>I was impressed.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>But what struck me was the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>way</i> she read.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Her voice rose and fell with the music of the story.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Various characters in the story spoke differently.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Surprises sounded surprising.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Danger sounded dangerous.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>And the happy ending sounded happy.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Very simply, she read the meaning of the story and not just the sound of the words.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of how public Bible reading usually sounds.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Most reading of Scripture is done in a listless, lifeless, muttering fashion that seems to communicate nothing more than the sound of the words without penetrating to the meaning of the words.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Unless a person knew better, he might think the reader is really expressing disrespect for Scripture and apathy about its message.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp;<br/> </span><br/> <strong>Lifeless Bible <place w:st='on'></place> <city w:st='on'></city>Reading </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible is the most amazing and powerful literature on earth.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Open its pages to almost any passage and the depth and impact is apparent.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>It is packed with drama, imagery, human interest, and divine involvement.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>It is alive with fascinating ancient history, soul stirring poetry, stinging moral prophecy, gripping gospel narrative, and riveting cosmic warfare.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>In spite of all this, it is often read aloud like a newspaper obituary.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even preachers tend to read their texts as though in a hurry to get to the important part of the sermon, their own interpretations.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>What an irony this is.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The preacher&rsquo;s commentary on a text is emphasized over the reading of the text itself.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>With the sermon text often being the only passage read in the service, Scripture is reduced to a role somewhere below the making of announcements.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may ask, &ldquo;How could you read the text aloud without the meaning coming through?&rdquo;<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>It is done all the time.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Just as a sermon can be preached in such a way that the intended meaning of the text is not communicated to the audience, so can the text be read in such a way that its meaning is lost in the apathetic muttering of the words.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advocates of expository preaching warn against the preacher imposing his thinking on the text and preaching that as exposition.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>This is called &ldquo;eisegesis&rdquo; as contrasted with &ldquo;exegesis.&rdquo;<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Exegesis</i>, so necessary for expository preaching, means &ldquo;drawing out&rdquo; of the text its meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Eisegesis</i> means &ldquo;bringing into&rdquo; the text the preacher&rsquo;s understandings as the meaning of the passage.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a parallel to this practice in the public reading of Scripture.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Expository reading is allowing the text to speak through the reader with its intended meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>But when the reader&rsquo;s vocal patterns and speech habits are imposed on the text, the intended meaning is smothered by this alien dialect.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Just as the text must shape the sermon in expository preaching, so the text must shape the interpretation in expository reading.<span style='mso-tab-count: 1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> </span><br/> <strong>What is Expository Scripture <place w:st='on'></place> <city w:st='on'></city>Reading ?</strong> </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>expository</i> reading I mean the reading of a Bible text with the intention of &ldquo;exposing&rdquo; its meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Expository preaching is that which allows the text to shape the sermon so that the intended meaning of the text comes through in the sermon.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Expository reading of Scripture has a similar purpose.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>It is the reading of a text in such a way that the intended meaning of the passage comes through in the reading.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expository reading of Scripture is not equivalent to &ldquo;dramatic&rdquo; reading.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>A dramatic reading is designed to impress the audience with the reading, with emphasis on the quality of voice, articulation, and vocal variety.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>It may sound impressive but artificial, calling attention more to the sound of the reading than to the meaning of the text.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>A dramatic style may seem staged and theatrical rather than simply expressive of the text&rsquo;s meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Just as imposing on the text a poor reader&rsquo;s speech patterns smothers the meaning, so the dramatic reading imposes on the text an affected style that can also obscure its meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The human vocal mechanism has an amazing capacity for expressing a wide range of styles.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>We do this all the time in conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Just listen to the conversation at a family cookout&mdash;the variety, the drama, the animation.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>But our most expressive speech styles are seldom employed in the reading of Scripture.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Instead we seem to go into a funereal singsong pattern when we read God&rsquo;s word.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>That style communicates boredom more than belief, for the reader and the audience.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expository reading is essentially reading the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>meaning</i> of the words instead of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>sound</i> of the words.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>This calls for constant attention on the part of the reader to the meaning of words.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>He does not just sound them and expect the hearer to draw out the meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>He visualizes the meaning of all significant words.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>As a result, different words take on different tones as the reader focuses on their meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Contrasting ideas in a text are expressed with the thought in mind&mdash;light and darkness, godly and wicked, weeping and rejoicing.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>And the audience can hear the difference.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A poor reading may indicate that the reader is bored with the text and thinks it of little importance.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The audience will discern that interpretation even if they do not consciously think about it.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>This is why much public reading of Scripture does little to enhance the congregation&rsquo;s appreciation of the Bible, and may even cause them to see the Bible in a more negative light.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Expository <place w:st='on'></place> <city w:st='on'></city>Reading and Sermon Preparation </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expository reading of Scripture is vital to the interpretation of a text for sermon preparation.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The primary expression of the interpretation of a text is not in preaching, but in the reading of it.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Every reading is an interpretation.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Most of Scripture was written to be read aloud.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Besides faithfulness to the original text, the quality of an English translation is determined to a great extent by its readability.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The phrases should flow, with the familiar vocabulary and word order of the language.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Paragraphing should guide the reader as to natural breaks in the thought.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Metaphorical language should be maintained for the appeal to imagination.&nbsp;<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving from the reading of a text aloud to the explanation of it in a sermon is a significant step.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Let me emphasize this again: the more direct means of interpretation is not preaching, but reading.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>We move away from the text and its central role in God&rsquo;s revelation when we add our comments to the wording of the text itself.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>This is not to say there is no place for teaching and preaching.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Rather it is to say that the more immediate and direct interpretive act is the oral reading of the text.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A central issue in the interpretation of Scripture is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>locus of meaning</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Where is the meaning located in our encounter with a text?&rdquo;<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Is it in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>reader</i> and his own thinking?<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Is it in the mind of the original <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>writer</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Is it in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>interaction</i> of the reader with the text?<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Or is it in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>words</i> of the text itself?<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The answer for most evangelicals is that the meaning will be found in the words of the text.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>locus of meaning</i> question is critical for expository preaching.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>But it is no less critical for expository reading.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Most public reading of the Bible is done in such a way that the hearer must discover the meaning for himself.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The words are not read for their meaning, but for their sound.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The sound of the words presents the symbols to the mind of the hearer that he must translate into meaning as the reading occurs.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s quip, &ldquo;The medium is the message,&rdquo; has often been quoted to emphasize the importance of the means of communication for shaping the message.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Research by speech communication scholars has demonstrated that 70 to 90% of the impact of a persuasive speech is in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>manner</i> of its delivery rather than in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>content</i> of the speech.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>This may well be true with sermons as well.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>It is also true of&nbsp;<br/> the public reading of Scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A preacher who first interprets the text orally through reading it aloud will be much better prepared to add his commentary to it for the sermon.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The purest form of interpretation of Scripture is the effective reading of it.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Most preachers, however, skip over careful preparation for reading the text.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>They may do a thorough exegesis.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>They may diagram the text.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>They may research text background.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>They may study the context.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>But they do not give it a voice in its own terms.</p> <p style='MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt' class='MsoNormal'>&nbsp;<strong>Letting the Text Speak</strong> </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expository reading requires careful preparation, particularly in the early development of this skill.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Later a reader can &ldquo;sight read&rdquo; a text with good effect. The central problem is shifting the style of the reading from habitual speech patterns comfortable to the reader to patterns that allow the meaning of the text to come through.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The reader will study the text carefully and mark it for emphasis, for pauses, for inflection, and for other factors that will make for effective reading.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every language has its music. <span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp;</span>The meaning of the words is central, but the expression of those words is critical as well.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The melodic patterns, pronunciation, vocal tone, and rhythm are all part of the language.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Expository reading calls for allowing the original writer to be heard in English or Spanish or Korean, with its normal sound.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The reader in any language will read with the music of that tongue so that the original writer seems to speak that language.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expository reading takes into account the genre of the text.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Different kinds of literature should be read in different ways.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Robert Jacks, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Just Say the Word</i>, identifies three basic kinds of texts for reading: didactic, narrative, and empathic. Didactic texts are driven by ideas.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Narrative texts are driven by the story.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Empathic texts are driven by emotion.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Each kind of text is read aloud in a way different from the others.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Within these categories are numerous other factors that require a particular style of reading.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these kinds of literature has a sound in the reader&rsquo;s language that fits the genre and expresses its particular dynamics.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>We do not read the Nativity story in Luke 2 the same way we read the theology of Romans 3.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Nor do we read the poetry of Psalm 23 in either of those styles.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Our aim is to give the text a voice to the contemporary audience, so we read it as the literature requires.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any oral reading of a biblical text is an interpretation of it.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Not only does the reader indicate what he thinks it says, he expresses what he thinks it means.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>He tries to recover for himself and his audience the original intention of the text writer.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>He intends to give the text a voice.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>To do so he will have to overcome the common disconnect between what he has in mind and what his speech actually expresses.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>He will have to move out of his comfort zone and become a servant of the text rather than a master of it.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Planning an Expository <place w:st='on'></place> <city w:st='on'></city>Reading</strong> </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning an expository reading is very similar to preparing an exegesis of the text.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>The primary difference is that you are thinking about the text as oral rather than written.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>You want to hear the text rather than just read it.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>You want to express it instead of just analyzing it.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of marking your Bible, I recommend copying the text in larger print and marking that copy for your analysis for oral interpretation.<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>Answer for yourself the following questions, realizing that many of them require you to express a particular interpretation of the text:<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span></p> <ol style='MARGIN-TOP: 0in' type='1'>     <li style='MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1' class='MsoNormal'>What kind of literature is it: didactic, empathic, or narrative?<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>This will set the pattern for your vocal variables as you read, either to communicate ideas, feelings, or a story. </li>     <li style='MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1' class='MsoNormal'>What seems to be the writer&rsquo;s purpose for the material?<span style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp; </span>What does he want from the audience?
