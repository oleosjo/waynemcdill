	<div align='center'><b><i><font size='4'>Faith-Based Leadership</font></i></b></div> <div align='center'><b>from <i>Letters to Matthew</i></b></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Dear Matthew:</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have already written, your leadership role as a young pastor is a challenge.&nbsp; Not only are you rather inexperienced and young enough to be the grandchild of may of your members, there is a fairly well defined set of leaders already established in the church.&nbsp; In the face of this situation you do well to rest in God&rsquo;s care and allow your influence to develop as an example to the people of the church.&nbsp; Let me suggest an interpretation of pastoral leadership that moves beyond age and experience.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strength of your leadership among God&#039;s people will come from your <i>faith in God</i>.&nbsp; Since they will inevitably respect your leadership on the basis of your character, you will want to conduct yourself in such a way as to call for such respect.&nbsp; The need here is not for religious legalism or spiritual aloofness.&nbsp; The need in your leadership is for confidence in God that will reflect attention back to Him.&nbsp; Your faith will inspire greater faith in the people and more confidence in you as His servant.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some pastors seem to base their leadership on the strength of personality.&nbsp; They are generally confident of themselves and bring that self-confidence to their pastoral role.&nbsp; Other pastors may base their leadership on their ability to keep everyone happy.&nbsp; They avoid conflict and work to accommodate all sides of every issue by trying to negotiate a resolution.&nbsp; Other pastors take a passive role in which they rarely state a position.&nbsp; Their response to any situation is to wait to see how things turn out.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of these or other personality-based strategies for leadership will faithfully represent the authority of God among his people.&nbsp; God has set up our relationship with Him so that we can properly relate to Him only by faith.&nbsp; To the extent that the pastor has confidence in God at key points, to that extent will his leadership reflect the presence and authority of God.&nbsp; With this basic confidence in God as the foundation, the pastor will be bold in his leadership.&nbsp; And the people will sense that his leadership comes from beyond himself.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much more to faith-based leadership than I can cover at this point.&nbsp; Let me just give you a summary of the key principles.&nbsp; I believe that your confidence in God in four major areas is the foundation for faith-based leadership--His providence, His word, His Spirit, and His grace.&nbsp; As you have faith in God in these areas, the difference in your attitude, speech, and actions will affect the congregation in a significant way.&nbsp; But this is not just a leadership strategy.&nbsp; It is not a methodology for influencing the church so that they follow you as pastor.&nbsp; These four points of faith will make of you the kind of person who can be trusted as a pastoral leader.&nbsp; Your faith will shape who you are as well as how you exercise pastoral leadership.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These four areas of confidence in God will result in corresponding leadership qualities that will be obvious to your people over the months and years as you work with them.&nbsp; If you have faith in God at these four points, you will have to express that faith in certain aspects of personal discipline.&nbsp; Without the action of this discipline, the faith is dead (James 2.17).&nbsp; Your faith and discipline will bring about a response in the people of confidence in you.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <p> <table bordercolor='#000000' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0' border='1'>     <tbody>         <tr>             <td valign='top' width='169'>             <div><b><i>Confidence in God</i></b></div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='222'>             <div><b><i>Spiritual Discipline</i></b></div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='229'>             <div><b><i>Leaderhip Quality</i></b></div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td valign='top' width='169'>             <div>His Providence</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='222'>             <div>Waiting on the Lord</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='229'>             <div>Steadfastness in every Situation</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td valign='top' width='169'>             <div>His Word</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='222'>             <div>Holding fast to the Word</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='229'>             <div>Wisdom for every Decision</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td valign='top' width='169'>             <div>His Spirit</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='222'>             <div>Walking in the Spirit</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='229'>             <div>Power for every Responsibility</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td valign='top' width='169'>             <div>His Grace</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='222'>             <div>Walking in the Light</div>             </td>             <td valign='top' width='229'>             <div>Freedom in every Relationship</div>             </td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> </p> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have confidence in the <i>providence</i> of God, you will have stability in every situation.&nbsp; God is greater than any circumstance, opposition, obstacle, crisis, tragedy, satanic attack, need, or challenge you will ever face in your ministry.&nbsp; Nothing can come to you except through Him (Job 1 &amp; 2).&nbsp; His purpose is sure (Isaiah 46.8-11; Ephesians 1.11).&nbsp; He is ever faithful (Psalm 36.5).&nbsp; His power is sufficient (Ephesians 1.19, 20).&nbsp; He will protect and provide for His servant (Psalm 91).&nbsp; He works everything out for good (Romans 8.28).&nbsp; Knowing all this, the servant of God is steadfast.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have confidence in the <i>Word</i> of God, you will have wisdom for every question.&nbsp; God&#039;s word is alive and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword (Hebrews 4.12).&nbsp; It is profitable for every need, that the man of God may be fully equipped (2 Timothy 3.16, 17).&nbsp; It will accomplish God&#039;s purpose without fail (Isaiah 55.8-13).&nbsp; Only as a pastor has full confidence in the word of God will he have spiritual authority in God&#039;s church.&nbsp; The word must be built into his life and then serve as a resource for every question.&nbsp; His ministry is the ministry of the word--in preaching, teaching, counseling, discipling, evangelizing, consoling, challenging--in every aspect of his work.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have confidence in the <i>Spirit</i> of God, you will have ability for every responsibility.&nbsp; God&#039;s man must walk in the Spirit if he is to have power among God&#039;s people.&nbsp; He must understand and trust the ministry of the Spirit for power (Acts 1.8), for illumination (John 16.13-15), for conviction (John 16.8-12), for Christlike character (Galatians 5.19-22), for overcoming the carnal nature (Galatians 5.16).&nbsp; The servant of God must be careful not to quench the Spirit with indifference (1 Thessalonians 5.19), resist the Spirit with stubbornness (Acts 7.51), or grieve the Spirit with unholiness (Ephesians 4.30).</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have confidence in the <i>grace</i> of God, you will have freedom in every relationship.&nbsp; God has reached down and lifted us up and will keep the feet of the Godly (1 Samuel 2.6-9).&nbsp; By the grace of God we are delivered from our sin and enabled to live the life that pleases God (Ephesians 2.8-10).&nbsp; We know that we are fully accepted in Christ, without condemnation, and that God is for us (Romans 8.1, 31-34).&nbsp; Our standing with God and our fellowship with Him are not based on works but by grace (Romans 11.6).&nbsp; By the grace of God you are what you are (1 Corinthians 15.10).</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In each of these four areas your faith must be expressed in daily discipline.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trusting in God&#039;s providence, you will <i>wait on the Lord</i> (Psalm 27.14) in every circumstance, however threatening.&nbsp; In your own strength you will waver and fall in the face of the threats that are normal to the ministry.&nbsp; But you know that He will provide everything that is needed, protect from all harm and open every door He wishes you to enter.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trusting in God&#039;s word, you will <i>hold fast to the word</i> for every decision, however perplexing (Titus 1.9).&nbsp; In your own wisdom, you will never be able to sort our the subtle questions posed by the deceiver.&nbsp; But you know that the truth of God&#039;s word provides you sure principles for the most complex issues and clear guidance for every decision that must be made.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trusting in God&#039;s Spirit, you will <i>walk in the Spirit</i> for every responsibility, however challenging (Galatians 5.16).&nbsp; In your own power, you will stumble and fall because this ministry requires supernatural energy.&nbsp; But you know that the indwelling Spirit of God will make you able to function in every aspect of your calling.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trusting in God&#039;s grace, you will <i>walk in the light</i> in every relationship, however tempting (1 John 1.7).&nbsp; On your own, you will be tempted to conceal your sins and boast of your virtues.&nbsp; But you know that you are what you are only by the grace of God and that your position in Christ is sure, allowing you to accept others by grace as well.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This faith and discipline on the part of their pastor will bring about a sense of respect and confidence in his leadership by the people.&nbsp; It will be a confidence that is rooted in God&#039;s own faithfulness.&nbsp; Godly character and faith points beyond the man to God Himself.&nbsp; The whole congregation, pastor and people alike, will look away from their own frailty to God, Who is our Provider, our Guide, our Enabler and our Deliverer.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize that this is a rather complex interpretation of faith-based leadership.&nbsp; Let me encourage you to study it further and put your confidence in God in these four critical areas.&nbsp; Never think that your leadership as a shepherd among God&#039;s people is dependent on your own abilities.&nbsp; Trust in Him for every need.&nbsp; Let your relationship with God be a resting that allows you to experience His peace.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continue to pray for you.&nbsp; God is with you.</div> <div>Love,</div> <div>Dad</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Wayne McDill</div> <div>Senior Professor of Preaching</div> <div>Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</div> <div><a href='http://www.waynemcdill.net/'>http://www.waynemcdill.net</a></div>	</td>
