	<div align='center'><b><font size='4'>Institution or Movement?</font></b></div> <div align='center'>The Aim of Church Planters</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human endeavors seem inevitably to move toward institutionalization. What begins as a movement turns into an organization. Unfortunately the same thing happens to the Christian church in a community. If a missionary church planter sees his mission as the initiation of a movement rather than the establishment of an institution, the results will be dramatic.<br/> </div> <div align='center'><strong>De-fi-ni&rsquo;tion<br/> </strong><strong>An <em>institution </em>is an organized societal entity with a social, educational or religious purpose institution, which seeks to utilize the resources, facilities, and programs it deems necessary for advancing its aims.</strong></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand we have to recognize that getting the work of the church done requires some institutionalizing. On the other hand we must face the fact that we often think of the establishment of a Christian ministry in a community as the formation of an institution. It could well be that this tendency to institutionalize hurts the dynamic of any Christian movement, whether it is a social ministry or a church plant.</div> <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div> <div><b>The Marks of an Institution</b></div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institutions can be recognized by certain necessary qualities. Though a particular missionary endeavor may not have all of these features, it will generally have enough of these qualities to make clear whether it is institutional.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions inevitably give themselves a name.</i>&nbsp; As the group names itself it is giving itself a corporate identity. This naming process is very significant for distinguishing the institution in its location, its affiliations, and its purpose.&nbsp; Those involved are then able to say, &ldquo;This is who we are as a group and an organization.&rdquo;</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions tend to become constitutional.</i> By this I mean that institutions tend to adopt a constitution and bylaws by which they will govern their activities. This constitutional tendency is very important for several reasons. Constituting as an institution requires an official name. Constituting as a group means that the movement is becoming official. It is setting up structures and guidelines by which it will operate. It is taking unto itself certain authority that is to be exercised within the institution. Sometimes church plants are not considered official until they &ldquo;constitute.&rdquo; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions usually have dedicated facilities.</i> This means they have buildings that are used only for the activities and work of the institution. A home bible study is therefore not institutionalized because it does not have dedicated facilities. An institutional approach to church planting always looks toward obtaining dedicated facilities as a milestone of success.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions tend to employ paid staff.</i> Whereas a small home bible study of Christians will not have any staff, a church will usually be &ldquo;official&rdquo; only if it has some kind of paid staff. The hiring of at least one paid staff member is a clear mark of institutionalization. It means that the group is enlisting professional help to get its work done. It means that the programs, facilities, equipment, organization, and other factors are developed to the extent that someone should be giving full time attention to keeping them in order. For a church, this staff member is usually the pastor. As the church grows other staff members are added. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions require financial resources to function.</i>&nbsp; Programs, facilities, and staff necessary to an institution all require financial resources that must be obtained if the institution is to continue.&nbsp; Raising money is usually a central concern of institutional leaders.&nbsp; The people in the group and those beyond may be viewed in terms of what they can contribute to the needs of the institution rather than how they can receive benefit from its ministry.&nbsp; For weak institutions, financial concerns become dominant.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions usually own equipment.</i> This can range from curriculum materials, copy machines and computers to automobiles and audiovisual equipment. It can involve furnishings for the dedicated facilities of the institution, such as furniture and a sound system.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions develop organizational structure.</i> This means they want to define the various assignments and authority patterns that everyone in the group will accept. An institution becomes departmentalized, with the work along the lines of various aims.&nbsp; The organization will also be hierarchical with levels of responsibility and oversight defined and various leadership roles defined.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions function in terms of programs.</i> Programs may be defined as detailed plans designed to achieve a particular goal by involving people in some aspect of the institution&rsquo;s activity. These programs involve marshalling the people to accomplish some purpose within the group or outside of the group. Churches tend to favor packaged plans such as evangelism programs they receive from denomination and other sources. Some of the most common programs used by Baptist church plants involve short-term mission teams from elsewhere. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions tend to develop traditions and a history that shape their identity.</i> Tradition is very important for institutions. Tradition forms a guiding set of principals and historical patterns that allow the institution to function from one year to the next in a familiar fashion. Traditions allow institutions to maintain an identity over the course of its life. Institutions develop a history, a story that explains its founding and its purpose. Institutions like to tell their story--who the founders were, what their aim was, what the key mileposts have been in the development of the institution through the years. All of these factors contribute to a corporate identity and a culture within the institution. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions develop a corporate culture.</i> There is usually a highly defined sense of who we are and how we do our work. This culture includes an ethic. The institution understands that there are certain right ways to do things that are characteristic of its activities. The corporate culture of an institution becomes something of a community personality. It affects the whole and is contributed to by each person involved. It is informed by the tradition of the institution and shaped by its abiding purpose. That culture may or may not be defined and stated explicitly. A newcomer to the institution is soon to learn &ldquo;How we do things around here.&rdquo; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions tend to be self-perpetuating.</i>&nbsp; Very seldom does a true movement arise out of an institution.&nbsp; If an institution spawns a daughter group, it will be institutional in nature.&nbsp; Spin off or split groups, even though intending to start something new, will inevitably preserve the underlying assumptions of the parent institution.&nbsp; As a result, the hope for a new approach is often disappointed.&nbsp; The philosophy and strategy of the missionary will set the DNA (the group purpose and approach) in the first place.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Institutions expend a high proportion of available energy on maintenance.</i>&nbsp; Much of the effort in an institution is devoted to the management of staff, facilities, equipment, organization and programs for participants.&nbsp; In the process, there may be little energy left for pursuing the original founding purpose.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of institutionalization on a Christian group can be presented by the use of a formula that assesses the energy level of the group.&nbsp; Here are the factors in the formula:</div> <ul>     <li>P&mdash;persons in the Christian group as to the number </li>     <li>S&mdash;spiritual vitality and motivation of the persons in the group </li>     <li>E&mdash;energy level of the group in terms of the time and effort they are able to contribute to the life of the group.&nbsp; </li>     <li>IM&mdash;institutional maintenance necessary for the physical, organizational, programmatic, and scheduling of the institution </li>     <li>GC&mdash;the Great Commission mandate of the Christian movement, making disciples<br/>     <br/>     &nbsp;<strong>The formula can be presented as follows:<br/>     </strong><strong>P X S = E&nbsp; [Number of persons times spiritual vitality equals the energy of the group.]<br/>     </strong><strong>The formula continues, however like, this:<br/>     </strong><strong>P X S = E &ndash; IM = GC&nbsp; [Energy of the group minus effort necessary for institutional maintenance equals the potential for pursuing founding purpose.]</strong> </li> </ul> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A church planter can assess the viability of his group for the Great Commission of making disciples by identifying the number (P) of persons (adults) he counts as core participants.&nbsp; The next part of the formula is rather subjective, but I have discovered that every pastor can give a ready answer.&nbsp; Here he assesses the spiritual maturity and vitality (S) of the group on the scale of 1 to 10, 1 being very immature or indifferent, 10 being spiritually mature and highly motivated.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two figures are multiplied, the number of core persons times the general spiritual vitality.&nbsp; The result is the energy (E) available for the work of the ministry.&nbsp; However, if the core group must spend some of its energy on support work necessary to institutional maintenance (IM), that much available energy must be subtracted. The institutional maintenance level can be ascertained by multiplying the number of persons involved by the hours worked for the support tasks that are not directly engaging persons in disciple making.&nbsp; Such tasks include setting up and taking down furniture and equipment, folding and mailing flyers, program planning and preparation, etc.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Institutional Maintenance figure is discovered, this must be subtracted from the Energy level to discover the available time and effort that can be devoted to disciple making, the Great Commission mandate of the church.&nbsp; The church planter should be sure to include his own efforts in these calculations.&nbsp; In doing so, he may discover that he spends much of his own time on maintenance work rather than person-to-person ministry toward making disciples.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast to thinking of his mission as the establishment of an institution, the missionary may see his calling as initiating a movement of God in the target community.<br/> <br/> </div> <div><strong>What is a Movement?</strong></div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since institutionalization seems inevitable in the growth of new church plants, I am raising a question here as to the timing. It seems that many church planters are setting out to establish an institution rather than be a catalyst <font color='#00ffff'>for</font> a Christian movement. By a movement I mean the dynamic involvement of a group of committed people in some worthy cause.<a title='' href='http://www.waynemcdill.net/admin/FCKeditor/editor/fckeditor.html?InstanceName=editor&amp;Toolbar=Default#_edn1' name='_ednref1'>[1]</a> A movement differs greatly from an institution. <br/> </div> <div align='center'><strong><br/> De-fi-ni&rsquo;tion</strong></div> <div align='center'><strong>A movement is an association of persons holding common commitments and aims, the purpose of which is to satisfy some perceived grievance, meet some perceived need, or gain some promised benefit.</strong></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement is marked by a keen consciousness of its aims</i>.&nbsp; Those involved in a movement are motivated by the vision of the group.&nbsp; They are conscious of a need the movement aims to address.&nbsp; The purpose of a movement is usually very simple and easily understood. In the case of a church planting movement, the aim is to provide spiritual ministry and fellowship.&nbsp; The aims of the group attract interest on the part of outsiders, first to receive what the group offers and later to give the same to others.</div> <div><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A movement tends to be dynamic rather than static.</i> This means there is a power in the group commitment to one another and the energy that flows in the pursuit of its purpose. The group is not locked into a settled structure and seeking some way for the organization to function. It only implements organizational structures as needed to allow it to function more effectively. The organization in a movement is usually minimal. Any lines of authority and departmentalization are functional rather than positional.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement tends to be spontaneous in nature rather than programmed.</i> There is a sense in a movement that a guiding hand is directing events from outside the group. At the same time the dynamic within the group is a force that seems to respond spontaneously to events and opportunities. This spontaneity allows for more initiative on the part of participants, as well as a more wide-open agenda for the group&rsquo;s activities.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement tends to come together around charismatic leaders.</i>&nbsp; People are naturally attracted to leaders who have a vision for addressing some need and a plan for achieving it.&nbsp; But more, they gather around leaders who are passionate about the aims of the movement and are ready to make the necessary sacrifices to achieve them.&nbsp; A missionary who ministers the grace and love of God to others will find a group gathering around his ministry.&nbsp; Such leaders are self-giving and others oriented visionaries who inspire confidence and loyalty.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement tends to be egalitarian in its structures of authority. </i>Apart from the influence of those recognized as leaders, there is an unspoken equality of members.&nbsp; Natural leaders will arise as they exercise influence in the group in keeping with group aims.&nbsp; Those who impress the group with striking ideas, personal charisma, commitment, and unusual abilities will become the functional leaders.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement tends to be relational in nature</i>. The energy of the group is connected more with the interaction of various members of the group than it is with the implementation of programs and plans. The sense of community is a significant factor in a movement. This sense of community meets significant needs on the part of participants: belonging, accountability, mutual trust, and acceptance. Relationships in the group hold it together, rather than organization, programs, or meetings.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement tends to grow by multiplication</i>. In a church planting movement there is a sense from the start that each group (cell or congregation) is responsible for starting other like groups.&nbsp; Groups can multiply in any direction when opportunities arise and God opens a door.&nbsp; There is a sense of the guiding hand of God from beyond the group and in its midst.&nbsp; The original philosophy of ministry, the spiritual DNA, catches from group to group as the movement spreads.<br/> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A movement is energized by self-giving service. </i>The leaders see themselves as edifiers and not exploiters, seeking to build up each person in Christ rather than seeking to gain something from him.&nbsp; Participants aim for service rather than enlistment.&nbsp; Participants express a genuine interest in each person&rsquo;s story and needs, inside and beyond the group. The group aims to give the love and grace of God at the point of each person&rsquo;s need. &nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement tends to spreads by contagion</i>. Whereas a church member may think little of how his church membership affects his personal goals and priorities, one involved in a movement will see the aims of the movement spilling over into his personal priorities in a significant way. The enthusiasm one person has for the central impact of the movement is directly proportionate to its effect in his own life. If he has received a life changing benefit from the movement, he will eagerly spread the word to others.&nbsp; One highly satisfied participant leads to another and then another.&nbsp; In a movement there tend to be fewer observers and more participants than in an institution.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A movement is not fulfilled in the establishment of an institution.</i>&nbsp; If a missionary aims to be the agent of Christ for the initiation of a church planting movement, he cannot be satisfied with the constituting of one church.&nbsp; A movement does not settle into a place and a space and call it success.&nbsp; Rather the horizons of success are ever receding.&nbsp; Those involved in a movement of God are carried along to dimensions they could never have imagined.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The church planter&rsquo;s vision must not be sketched in terms of an ending point and a standard of success.&nbsp; It must rather define a set of convictions derived from biblical authority&mdash;a philosophy and methodology from God.</div> <div>&nbsp; <div align='left'>Wayne McDill</div> <div align='left'>Senior Professor of Preaching</div> <div align='left'>Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</div> </div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div><br clear='all'/><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%'/> <div id='edn1'> <div><a title='' href='http://www.waynemcdill.net/admin/FCKeditor/editor/fckeditor.html?InstanceName=editor&amp;Toolbar=Default#_ednref1' name='_edn1'>[1]</a> See Charles J.
