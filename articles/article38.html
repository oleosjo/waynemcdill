	<div align='center'>YOUR EMOTIONS ARE TRYING</div> <div align='center'>TO TELL YOU SOMETHING</div> <div align='center'>by Wayne McDill</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Katherine on a plane into Dallas.&nbsp; I am not sure how we got into our discussion of Lloyd.&nbsp; Her distress was surely a strong motivation for her to talk about him.&nbsp; She had only been married to Lloyd for two years, but long enough to know he was in serious trouble in his attitude toward life.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lloyd had been quite successful in his business, but he decided to retire so that he and his first wife, Theresa, could travel abroad.&nbsp; They went to Europe and wandered those beautiful, old cities.&nbsp; They had everything they wanted -- money, time, and each other.&nbsp; Lloyd was grateful to God for his blessings.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Theresa became ill with cancer.&nbsp; Their travels came to an abrupt end as their whole life was devoted to her recovery.&nbsp; They turned to God in prayer.&nbsp; Lloyd asked people at church to pray.&nbsp; He asked friends to pray.&nbsp; He asked family members to pray.&nbsp; He asked for healing and believed that God would give it.&nbsp; After a few short months, however, Theresa died.&nbsp; Lloyd reacted to her death with bitterness.&nbsp; How could God take her away from him?&nbsp; How was that loving and good?&nbsp; He said he would never pray again.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Theresa&#039;s death Lloyd had done little but watch television and play an occasional game of golf.&nbsp; He began to drink as he never had before.&nbsp; Friends who invited him to play golf in an effort to get him out experienced Lloyd&#039;s bitterness and hostility toward them as well.&nbsp; He complained that no one really cared about him.&nbsp; Lloyd&#039;s life had become a tangle of painful emotions.&nbsp; Within less than two years, Lloyd married Katherine.&nbsp; Now the bitterness broke out in his often angry and hostile attitude toward her. &nbsp;Now Katherine was telling me this sad story.&nbsp; What could she do to help Lloyd?</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emotion is so much a part of being human that we cannot imagine life without it.&nbsp; Our emotions motivate us, harass us, and provoke us.&nbsp; Every experience of life is colored and shaped by emotion.&nbsp; As natural as emotion is, we still have difficulty understanding it.&nbsp; One of the mysteries of emotion is the independent control it has.&nbsp; Our feelings seem to have a will of their own.&nbsp; They can hit you like the flu before you even realize it.&nbsp; </div> <div><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Emotions have their positive side as well, of course.<i>&nbsp; </i>Imagine a football game without the cheers, the 'high fives,' and the end zone dance.&nbsp; Imagine a relationship without the warmth, affection, and trust.&nbsp; Imagine Christmas without the anticipation, the delight, and the excitement.&nbsp; Emotion is the spicy flavor of life.&nbsp; It is the color and zest that mere rational and volitional responses can never deliver.&nbsp; It is the adventure of life played out in your passions.&nbsp; Emotion is a wonderful wind that can fill your sails or sink your ship.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the primary clues a physician uses to discover what is ailing you is to ask, 'Where does it hurt?'&nbsp; God has built a marvelous warning system into our physical makeup.&nbsp; When we feel pain we know something is wrong.&nbsp; Like a siren going off in our minds, pain calls our attention to a hurt finger, sick stomach, or throbbing tooth. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emotional pain is also normal.&nbsp; It is a warning that something is out of order.&nbsp; You may feel just a little loneliness, a bit of anger, a mild frustration, or you could experience more serious and ongoing suffering.&nbsp; Either way, it is an alarm to get your attention, to send you a message about trouble in some area of your life.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div><b>The Roots of Bitterness</b></div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Lloyd suffered more than one kind of emotional pain, the primary trouble was with <i>bitterness</i>.&nbsp; He was angry with God at the death of his wife.&nbsp; He had everything planned for their retirement, but the cancer took Theresa.&nbsp; Lloyd had prayed as never before in his life.&nbsp; He had tried to believe God would heal her, asking others to pray for her healing as well.&nbsp; This must not happen: she must not die.&nbsp; But she did, and there was no one to blame but God.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Bitterness</i> and <i>resentment</i> are expressions of a cluster of emotions related to <i>anger</i>.&nbsp; These emotions are a warning of some threat to your <i>control</i> of your life. &nbsp;A basic area of human responsibility is <i>authority</i>.&nbsp; Lloyd had never really come to terms with authority.&nbsp; All his life he had thought he was in charge.&nbsp; Even his relationship with God was not so much a humble surrender as a business partnership.&nbsp; Now Lloyd demanded that God answer for this terrible and senseless loss.&nbsp; When God was silent, he vowed never to speak to him again.&nbsp; Like a pouting child, he would make God suffer for His mistake.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person does not develop an angry spirit over night.&nbsp; It takes years of training.&nbsp; The angry person learns as a child that he has a right to be in control.&nbsp; Children naturally resist the control others would exercise over them.&nbsp; Even an infant will demand control by resisting a diaper change or screaming his protest over not being held.&nbsp; From that early beginning, the parents must decide how they will deal with this natural demand for control by their little angel.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than requiring the child to comply with their wishes, many parents try to reach some accommodation to keep the child happy.&nbsp; They avoid directly confronting his resistant spirit by attempting to manipulate him in some way.&nbsp; They may try to divert his attention, or just put up with his anger.&nbsp; In the meantime, they are teaching the child to demand control and to make trouble for those who do not yield to him.&nbsp; By the time this child grows up, he has come to feel that everyone should comply with his wishes.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how reasonable is it to expect to control everything?&nbsp; Freeway driving is a vivid example of our need to examine our expectations.&nbsp; There are few human experiences so likely to provoke anger as driving.&nbsp; Of course, it is the other drivers who cause the trouble.&nbsp; They cut in front of us.&nbsp; They drive too slowly.&nbsp; They drive too fast.&nbsp; They do not seem to pay attention.&nbsp; They drive in the wrong lane.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the question: 'Can I reasonably expect to be in control of the highway, including all of the other drivers?'&nbsp; Do I really imagine that the traffic should part before me as though I were driving an ambulance with lights flashing and siren blaring?&nbsp; Anger in traffic reveals that we <i>feel</i> we should have our way on the highway.&nbsp; But that is hardly a reasonable expectation.&nbsp; Once you confront yourself with the foolishness of such an idea, you will find your anger fading.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lloyd&#039;s loss of his wife left him seriously wounded emotionally.&nbsp; Because he had come to assume he should have his way, he could not handle such a devastating reversal.&nbsp; He had prayed.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that what God requires for getting your way?&nbsp; Lloyd was not following this line of thought consciously, but he was in the habit of dealing with life on these terms.&nbsp; It was the only way he knew, and it had worked fairly well up to now.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was faulty thinking.&nbsp; Responsibility for authority calls for coming to terms with the authority of a sovereign God and a world ordered by authority.<br/> <br/> <b>Seven Kinds of Trouble</b></div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years ago, as a pastoral counselor, I began to make a list of every negative emotion I could think of.&nbsp; Most of the feelings fell together naturally into seven groups with similar qualities.&nbsp; Then I found that each cluster of emotional pain was related to a particular natural desire.&nbsp; Any apparent threat to that desire triggered a corresponding emotional warning.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first cluster of emotional pain surrounds <b><i>self-doubt</i></b>.&nbsp; It means simply that you are feeling inferior or unworthy instead of confident and positive.&nbsp; These feelings can range all the way from a minor embarrassment to real humiliation.&nbsp; They are all signaling a threat to your self-worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second cluster centers on the emotion of <b><i>anger</i></b>.&nbsp; Anger is that feeling of aggression and hostility that surges up in the face of mistreatment or injustice, or when you do not get your way.&nbsp; It is a warning about a threat to your own control of your life and circumstances.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is the group of emotions related to <b><i>loneliness</i></b>.&nbsp; Loneliness is the feeling that no one cares, that you are separated from someone you love.&nbsp; Mulling over a strained relationship, sending your 'baby' off to college, listening as the phone never rings -- these are formulas for loneliness, signaling a threat to your desire for companionship. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth cluster relates to the idea of <b><i>boredom</i></b>.&nbsp; This is a sense of listlessness and indifference on the one hand or frustration on the other.&nbsp; Boredom or frustration can result when a project fails, when your job seems to be a meaningless routine, or when you can&#039;t think of what to do with a little leisure time.&nbsp; They signal a threat to your desire for achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the center of the fifth cluster is the emotional pain of <b><i>worry</i></b>.&nbsp; When you worry you feel vulnerable and unprotected, grieving in advance over the loss of something precious.&nbsp; Worry warns of a threat to the security of something or someone precious to you.&nbsp; There are so many things to worry about -- a lump that shouldn&#039;t be there, a teen-ager two hours late getting in, that advancing swarm of fire ants reported in the news.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Guilt</i></b> is the distress at the heart of the next cluster.&nbsp; Guilt as an emotion is that sense of remorse or sorrow at the realization of your wrong behavior.&nbsp; You can feel guilty for eating a candy bar, turning away from a beggar, or sleeping with your best friend&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; Feelings of guilt are warning of a threat to your desire for personal integrity.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final group of emotions centers in <b><i>discontent</i></b>, warning of a threat to your personal peace.&nbsp; When you feel discontented, you are restless, uneasy, and alert to the irritants in your present situation.&nbsp; The feeling of discontent can be triggered by something as insignificant as a spot on the rug or as discouraging as a dead-end job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The message in these emotions can range from a rather mild alert to a serious warning.&nbsp; Imagine having your own inner security guard monitoring all that goes on around you to watch out for any threat to your well-being.&nbsp; When he sees what he thinks is a threat, he hits that warning button and you experience the appropriate emotional pain.&nbsp; Of course, he could be wrong.&nbsp; His interpretation is only as good as your own assumptions about life.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div><b>Getting the Message</b></div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me suggest a six-step plan for reading the message in your emotions.&nbsp; Only as your get the intended message can you respond to it wisely.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First, pay attention to your emotional pain.&nbsp; Analyze it to determine as clearly as you can what emotion it is.&nbsp; Identifying which emotional signals you are experiencing helps take the mystery out of your emotions.&nbsp; A good way to do this is to write a description, <i>What Has Happened and How I Feel About It</i>.&nbsp; Make it vivid and as honest to your feelings as possible.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Trace each emotion you have identified to the corresponding natural desire.&nbsp; If you were <i>embarrassed</i>, trace it to your desire for <i>self-worth</i>.&nbsp; Look closely at the circumstances and events that provoked the reaction.&nbsp; Describe how your self-worth seemed to be threatened.&nbsp; Add this to your written description.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Honestly assess whether any normal person would feel as you did.&nbsp; Don&#039;t tell yourself, 'I shouldn&#039;t feel this way,' just because the emotions were unpleasant.&nbsp; It is perfectly normal to feel embarrassed when everyone sees you spill your coffee on the white linen tablecloth.&nbsp; If the emotional signal is overdone or prolonged, however, there may be more to it than a natural reaction.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Identify why you felt threatened and assess it objectively.&nbsp; If something your best friend said caused you to feel <i>alienated</i> and <i>lonely</i>, why?&nbsp; Was it the words, or the tone of voice, or maybe your own mood at the moment?&nbsp; Is your friendship really threatened or did your emotional security guard overreact?&nbsp; If you got angry in traffic, ask whether you should expect to control the whole highway. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Analyze whether your emotional reaction was rooted in some emotional <i>injury</i> or <i>disease</i>.&nbsp; By <i>injury</i> I mean some hurtful experience of the past that has left its scars -- childhood abuse, personal failure, betrayal by one you love.&nbsp; By <i>disease</i> I mean some faulty assumptions that can cause you to misinterpret what happens, like the idea that somebody owes you a happy and prosperous life.&nbsp; Emotional injuries can be healed and wrong thinking corrected, but sometimes the process requires serious changes in your attitude and your outlook on life.&nbsp; You may need a friend or counselor to help you work through it.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Evaluate your experience and emotions by the truth of God&#039;s word and the enabling of the Spirit.&nbsp; Identify the principles in Scripture that can bring your thinking and expectations into line with biblical ideas.&nbsp; Write a description entitled, <i>God&#039;s Interpretation of What Happened.</i>&nbsp; Determine to <i>act </i>according to these principles rather than <i>reacting</i> from your natural human inclinations.&nbsp; Unless you intend to walk in the Spirit, you will respond out of your lower nature.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have thought of Lloyd Mitchell often since that plane ride with Katherine years ago.&nbsp; I never saw her again.&nbsp; I never learned about the rest of the story.&nbsp; It is always tragic when a person is trapped in attitudes that only bring misery to him and those around him.&nbsp; If only Lloyd had been able to read the message in his emotions.&nbsp; He would have known that his painful emotions were warning him every day about his wrong attitudes and ideas.&nbsp; He could have faced the real problem instead of blaming his troubles on the circumstances.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are messages in your emotions too.&nbsp; As painful as these distressing feelings may be, they can serve you well by alerting you to an area of personal responsibility that needs attention.&nbsp; When you are threatened in your inherent desires, the alarm will sound.&nbsp; Pay close attention.&nbsp; Identify the emotion.&nbsp; Trace it to the area of responsibility it reflects.&nbsp; Correct your interpretation and take action to respond.&nbsp; Let your emotions serve as they were intended to in God&#039;s design.&nbsp; Let them give you their message.</div> <br/> <div align='left'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Wayne McDill</font></div> <div align='left'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Senior Professor of Preaching</font></div> <div align='left'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</font></div> <div align='left'><font face='Arial' size='2'><a title='http://www.waynemcdill.net/' href='http://www.waynemcdill.net/'>http://www.waynemcdill.net</a></font></div>	</td>
