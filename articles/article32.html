	<div align="center"><b><i><font size="5">The Exploiter&rsquo;s Trap</font></i></b></div> <div align="center"><b>from <i>Letters to Matthew</i></b></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Dear Matthew:</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have observed pastors through the years, I have noticed a serious mistake in the approach some of them took to their work.&nbsp; I have called this fatal error 'the exploiter&#039;s trap.'&nbsp; Even though this 'trap' will ultimately ensnare a pastor and ruin his ministry in a church, the approach seems so reasonable at the time.&nbsp; Let me describe two kinds of pastors, the <i>exploiter</i> and the <i>edifier</i>, and how one of them falls into this deadly trap. </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One pastor, the <i>exploiter</i>, sets out to build a great church for the glory of God.&nbsp; He sees his calling as pastor to be motivating and mobilizing the congregation in the work of the kingdom.&nbsp; He believes that the great burden for this task is upon him and that the test of his success will be the growth of the church, in membership, outreach, facilities and programs.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His primary challenge for building a great church for God is to tap into the gifts and resources of the people.&nbsp; If only they will give themselves to the task, there is no limit to what God can do to enlarge the work.&nbsp; But motivating and mobilizing the people of the church is no easy task.&nbsp; He must train leaders and witnesses and givers for maximizing the possibilities God has placed in the church.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the people to be motivated, the pastor must give them a vision of the possibilities.&nbsp; This 'vision casting' is a primary challenge, for without it there is no unifying idea of what God has called the church to do.&nbsp; If the congregation can only catch a 'vision' of that God-ordained future, they can give themselves to making it a reality.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His chief opportunity for motivating the people is his preaching. &nbsp;In the pulpit ministry week after week the pastor must lay the vision before them.&nbsp; He must shake them out of their lethargy and energize them with the desire to obey God.&nbsp; Week after week he preaches to the church about launching out in faith to do what God has called the church to do.&nbsp; He challenges them&nbsp; about giving, serving, going, witnessing, and teaching--whatever it takes to get the work of God done.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most churches, however, this pastor finds a less than impressive response.&nbsp; He preaches soul-stirring sermons Sunday after Sunday, but the majority of his people are lethargic.&nbsp; They seem to listen and even comment favorably on his sermon, but nothing really changes.&nbsp; They seem content to just come to the Sunday morning service and sit.&nbsp; There is so much potential there, but he cannot seem to tap into it.&nbsp; They are still distracted by their own interests instead of being devoted to the work of the kingdom.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pastor is frustrated by this lack of commitment.&nbsp; It is obvious that they do not care about the things of God.&nbsp; He wonders how many of them are really saved.&nbsp; As he prays and agonizes over their apathy, he realizes that he must turn up the heat.&nbsp; Preaching the vision is needed.&nbsp; But these people must hear another message first.&nbsp; They must be warned against their carnality and indifference about the things of God.&nbsp; He will have to play the role of the prophet and call sin what it is.&nbsp; They will never see the vision until they are right with God.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he begins to preach on the sins of moral compromise, indifference to the things of God, failure to support the work of the kingdom through the church.&nbsp; He charges them with robbing God, with living lives of ease and compromise while the world goes to hell around them.&nbsp; He allows his own disappointment with them to come through in the sermons.&nbsp; They need the hard, cold truth, he thinks, and he is going to keep giving it to them.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The congregation responds positively at first, telling him that he is 'really stepping on their toes.'&nbsp; But as the weeks go by the passion of the pastor for their failure begins to chafe with the people.&nbsp; He continues to concentrate on their sins while implying that if only he had a corps of faithful workers, his vision for the church could be fulfilled.&nbsp; 'You don&#039;t care!' he shouts, and the people can tell he is frustrated.&nbsp; 'You just come and sit here with blank faces while the work of God goes wanting!'</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In time these accusations begin to get old.&nbsp; The people know the pastor is unhappy with them, that he is disappointed in their faithfulness, that he doesn&#039;t have much hope that they will ever get right and live up to his expectations.&nbsp; This sense of rejection and accusation causes them to withdraw from the pastor somewhat.&nbsp; They are becoming defensive and emotionally moving away from him to protect themselves.&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pastor senses the growing distance between his audience and himself in the services.&nbsp; He sees this as a spiritual battle so he decides to come down harder on sin and indifference.&nbsp; The word of God makes His wrath clear against the backslidden and unfaithful servant.&nbsp; So the pastor makes sure his congregation gets that message in no uncertain terms.&nbsp; He is becoming more discouraged because no matter how passionately he preaches, the enthusiasm of the people seems to sink even further.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is this downward spiral going?&nbsp; It takes no genius to see that it can only get worse.&nbsp; And ultimately it is headed for a divorce of some kind.&nbsp; Either the pastor will decide his ministry is finished at this church and work something out to move on, or church leaders will decide the church is not prospering under his ministry.&nbsp; Either way, the trap has closed on this pastor.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was his mistake?&nbsp; Why did he fall into such a trap?&nbsp; In the first place I question the idea that the pastor&#039;s aim should be to 'build a great church for the glory of God.'&nbsp; Jesus said, 'I will build my church,' and to us he said 'You make disciples.'&nbsp; A ministry based on institutional success is out of phase with the calling of Christ for the pastor.&nbsp; He is primarily a shepherd, not a C.E.O.&nbsp; His main concern is for the sheep, not the institution.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask yourself this question.&nbsp; If the people in my church grow in Christ under the care of a loving shepherd, will the church probably grow?&nbsp; But will the institution succeed unless the sheep are being fed, nurtured, and guided by a caring shepherd?&nbsp; There is a vision for the church in Scripture, but it is not a vision of institutional success.&nbsp; It is a vision of moral and spiritual faithfulness.&nbsp; It is a vision of God Himself at work in the world, using human agency to get that work done.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest error of the exploiter may be that he sees the people of the church as his resource for the kingdom&#039;s work.&nbsp; So he presses and challenges the people to do more.&nbsp; He is never quite satisfied with their faithfulness, so he keeps pushing.&nbsp; They can tell he is discouraged with them and thinks them unfaithful.&nbsp; The answer to this dilemma is that God is the Source for every need.&nbsp; 'My God shall supply all your needs through his riches in glory in Christ Jesus' (Phil. 4:19). </div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preaching ministry of the pastor is not for marshaling the energies and resources of his people.&nbsp; It is for teaching them the truths of God&#039;s word to build their faith.&nbsp; Preaching is not for getting something out of the people, but for putting something into them.&nbsp; It is not for tearing them down, but for building them up.&nbsp; It is not for turning them inward in self-examination, but for turning them outward toward the reality of God.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the pastor has to preach on the sins of the people, the best approach is to show that sin in light of the greatness of God, His love, and His promises.&nbsp; You can concentrate on all that God has done for us rather than what we are to do for Him.&nbsp; The growing faith that results from this kind of preaching will be a strong motivation for moral purity and faithful service.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of following the approach of the <i>exploiter</i>, it seems wise to me to do the work of the <i>edifier</i>.&nbsp; Do what you can to make disciples, faithful followers of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Teach them to have faith in God to meet every need.&nbsp; See yourself as the servant of the members of your church rather than the mobilizer of them.&nbsp; Present them a vision of the body of Christ alive and empowered as his servants in the world, rather than the church as an aggressive business with an eye on the bottom line.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also remember that the best motivator is a good example.&nbsp; If you want the church to reach the unbeliever, show them yourself how it is done.&nbsp; If you want them to give sacrificially, set the pace yourself.&nbsp; If you want them to be enthusiastic about the ministry of the church, let them hear you express your enthusiasm in positive and affirming terms.</div> <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew, I know you probably do not need to hear this challenge.&nbsp; Your approach to ministry is already that of the good shepherd who seeks to build up the sheep rather than use them.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this is such an important principle to understand.&nbsp; Think in through and make sure you are not lured into the exploiter&#039;s trap.</div> <div>Love, </div> <div>Dad</div>	</td>
