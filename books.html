The preacher is urged to preach without notes and told how to do so. The premise is that a sermon is not a sermon until it is preached. Oral communication was and is the basic form of communication for God&rsquo;s servants.

The threat may not be physical&#44; however&#44; but a threat to our naturally self-interested desires. This book identifies seven clusters of negative emotions that signal that sense of threat. Each is related to a basic desire and an area of responsibility. As we learn to read the emotional signals&#44; we can choose how to respond in the best way. Rather than allowing our emotions to provoke us&#44; we can read the signals and act wisely. </p>";document.getElementById("bookImg").src = "images/Lbook3.jpg"; return false;'>
