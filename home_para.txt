    This is my internet home base. I am glad you came by. My interests are primarily in various aspects of Evangelical Christian ministry. Preaching is a first love, especially expository preaching. Evangelism is also of interest, with emphasis on relational evangelism. I am also very interested in church planting and how to find more effective strategies for today’s challenge. Pastoral leadership is another interest, with a desire to encourage a servant shepherd model based on confidence in God. Articles on these subjects will be posted here.
    If you have interest in these areas and ideas to share, offer your comments on the board. I hope this site can be another meeting place for those interested in these areas of ministry. We need each other. And we need to keep in touch. God’s best to you as you serve Him faithfully.
